                "summary": "In this paper, we focus on the One-shot Novel View Synthesis (O-NVS) task\nwhich targets synthesizing photo-realistic novel views given only one reference\nimage per scene. Previous One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields\n(OG-NeRF) methods solve this task in an inference-time finetuning-free manner,\nyet suffer the blurry issue due to the encoder-only architecture that highly\nrelies on the limited reference image. On the other hand, recent\ndiffusion-based image-to-3d methods show vivid plausible results via distilling\npre-trained 2D diffusion models into a 3D representation, yet require tedious\nper-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, we propose the GD$^2$-NeRF, a\nGenerative Detail compensation framework via GAN and Diffusion that is both\ninference-time finetuning-free and with vivid plausible details. In detail,\nfollowing a coarse-to-fine strategy, GD$^2$-NeRF is mainly composed of a\nOne-stage Parallel Pipeline (OPP) and a 3D-consistent Detail Enhancer\n(Diff3DE). At the coarse stage, OPP first efficiently inserts the GAN model\ninto the existing OG-NeRF pipeline for primarily relieving the blurry issue\nwith in-distribution priors captured from the training dataset, achieving a\ngood balance between sharpness (LPIPS, FID) and fidelity (PSNR, SSIM). Then, at\nthe fine stage, Diff3DE further leverages the pre-trained image diffusion\nmodels to complement rich out-distribution details while maintaining decent 3D\nconsistency. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world\ndatasets show that GD$^2$-NeRF noticeably improves the details while without\nper-scene finetuning.",

                "summary": "Deep Metric Learning (DML) plays an important role in modern computer vision\nresearch, where we learn a distance metric for a set of image representations.\nRecent DML techniques utilize the proxy to interact with the corresponding\nimage samples in the embedding space. However, existing proxy-based DML methods\nfocus on learning individual proxy-to-sample distance while the overall\ndistribution of samples and proxies lacks attention. In this paper, we present\na novel proxy-based DML framework that focuses on aligning the sample and proxy\ndistributions to improve the efficiency of proxy-based DML losses.\nSpecifically, we propose the Data-Augmented Domain Adaptation (DADA) method to\nadapt the domain gap between the group of samples and proxies. To the best of\nour knowledge, we are the first to leverage domain adaptation to boost the\nperformance of proxy-based DML. We show that our method can be easily plugged\ninto existing proxy-based DML losses. Our experiments on benchmarks, including\nthe popular CUB-200-2011, CARS196, Stanford Online Products, and In-Shop\nClothes Retrieval, show that our learning algorithm significantly improves the\nexisting proxy losses and achieves superior results compared to the existing\nmethods.",

We focus on outcomes derived from self-reported survey data eliciting\nsocially undesirable, illegal, or stigmatized behaviors like tax evasion,\nsubstance abuse, or domestic violence, where too many \"false zeros\", or more\nbroadly, underreporting are likely. We provide characterizations for\ndistributional parallel trends, a concept central to our approach, within a\ngeneral threshold-crossing model framework. In cases where outcomes are assumed\nto be reported correctly, we propose a framework for identifying and estimating\ntreatment effects across the entire distribution. This framework is then\nextended to modeling underreported outcomes, allowing the reporting decision to\ndepend on treatment status. A simulation study documents the finite sample\nperformance of the estimators. Applying our methodology, we investigate the\nimpact of recreational marijuana legalization for adults in several U.S. states\non the short-term consumption behavior of 8th-grade high-school students. The\nresults indicate small, but significant increases in consumption probabilities\nat each level. These effects are further amplified upon accounting for\nmisreporting.",

                "summary": "We study the evolution of the two-pion correlation function parameters with\ncollision energy in the context of relativistic heavy-ion collisions within the\nNICA energy range. To this end, we perform UrQMD simulations in the cascade\nmode to produce samples of pions from $5\\times 10^6$ Bi+Bi collisions for each\nof the studied energies. The effects of the quantum-statistical correlations\nare introduced using the correlation afterburner code CRAB. We fit the\ncorrelation function using Gaussian, exponential and symmetric L\\'evy shapes\nand show that for all collision energies the latter provides the best fit. We\nseparate the sample into pions coming from primary processes and pions\noriginating from the decay of long-lived resonances, and show that the source\nsize for the latter is significantly larger than for the former. The source\nsize for the secondaries, is similar but in general larger than the size for\nthe whole pion sample. To further characterize the pion source, we also\nsimulate the effects of a non-ideal detector introducing a momentum smearing\nparameter, representing the minimum pair momentum and thus a maximum source\nsize that can be resolved. The values of the correlation function intercept\nparameter are therefore modified from the values they attain for the perfect\ndetector case. Using the core-halo picture of the source, we show that the\nvalues of the intercept parameter are influenced by the presence of a\nsignificant fraction of core pions coming from the decay of long-lived but\nslow-moving resonances. These findings serve as a benchmark to compare with\nfuture Monte Carlo studies that consider an Equation of State and thus allow\nfor a phase transition within the studied energy domain.",

Mainstream FL\nmethodologies overlook the dynamic nature of real-world data, particularly its\ntendency to grow in volume and diversify in classes over time. This oversight\nresults in FL methods suffering from catastrophic forgetting, where the trained\nmodels inadvertently discard previously learned information upon assimilating\nnew data. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel Federated\nClass-Incremental Learning (FCIL) method, named \\underline{Fed}erated\n\\underline{C}lass-Incremental \\underline{L}earning with New-Class\n\\underline{A}ugmented \\underline{S}elf-Di\\underline{S}tillation (FedCLASS). The\ncore of FedCLASS is to enrich the class scores of historical models with new\nclass scores predicted by current models and utilize the combined knowledge for\nself-distillation, enabling a more sufficient and precise knowledge transfer\nfrom historical models to current models. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that\nFedCLASS stands on reliable foundations, considering scores of old classes\npredicted by historical models as conditional probabilities in the absence of\nnew classes, and the scores of new classes predicted by current models as the\nconditional probabilities of class scores derived from historical models.\nEmpirical experiments demonstrate the superiority of FedCLASS over four\nbaseline algorithms in reducing average forgetting rate and boosting global\naccuracy.",

                "summary": "Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a statistical method for identifying\nand confirming the presence of latent factors among observed variables through\nthe analysis of their covariance structure. Compared to alternative factor\nmodels, CFA offers interpretable common factors with enhanced specificity and a\nmore adaptable approach to covariance structure modeling. However, the\napplication of CFA has been limited by the requirement for prior knowledge\nabout \"non-zero loadings\" and by the lack of computational scalability (e.g.,\nit can be computationally intractable for hundreds of observed variables). We\npropose a data-driven semi-confirmatory factor analysis (SCFA) model that\nattempts to alleviate these limitations. SCFA automatically specifies \"non-zero\nloadings\" by learning the network structure of the large covariance matrix of\nobserved variables, and then offers closed-form estimators for factor loadings,\nfactor scores, covariances between common factors, and variances between errors\nusing the likelihood method. Therefore, SCFA is applicable to high-throughput\ndatasets (e.g., hundreds of thousands of observed variables) without requiring\nprior knowledge about \"non-zero loadings\". Through an extensive simulation\nanalysis benchmarking against standard packages, SCFA exhibits superior\nperformance in estimating model parameters with a much-reduced computational\ntime. We illustrate its practical application through factor analysis on two\nhigh-dimensional RNA-seq gene expression datasets.",

This survey aims to systematically address these\nchallenges by reviewing a broad spectrum of techniques designed to enhance the\nresource efficiency of LLMs. We categorize methods based on their optimization\nfocus: computational, memory, energy, financial, and network resources and\ntheir applicability across various stages of an LLM's lifecycle, including\narchitecture design, pretraining, finetuning, and system design. Additionally,\nthe survey introduces a nuanced categorization of resource efficiency\ntechniques by their specific resource types, which uncovers the intricate\nrelationships and mappings between various resources and corresponding\noptimization techniques. A standardized set of evaluation metrics and datasets\nis also presented to facilitate consistent and fair comparisons across\ndifferent models and techniques. By offering a comprehensive overview of the\ncurrent sota and identifying open research avenues, this survey serves as a\nfoundational reference for researchers and practitioners, aiding them in\ndeveloping more sustainable and efficient LLMs in a rapidly evolving landscape.",

WSAC is designed as a two-player Stackelberg game to\noptimize a refined objective function. The actor optimizes the policy against\ntwo adversarially trained value critics with small importance-weighted Bellman\nerrors, which focus on scenarios where the actor's performance is inferior to\nthe reference policy. In theory, we demonstrate that when the actor employs a\nno-regret optimization oracle, WSAC achieves a number of guarantees: (i) For\nthe first time in the safe offline RL setting, we establish that WSAC can\nproduce a policy that outperforms any reference policy while maintaining the\nsame level of safety, which is critical to designing a safe algorithm for\noffline RL. (ii) WSAC achieves the optimal statistical convergence rate of\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$ to the reference policy, where $N$ is the size of the offline\ndataset. (iii) We theoretically show that WSAC guarantees a safe policy\nimprovement across a broad range of hyperparameters that control the degree of\npessimism, indicating its practical robustness. Additionally, we offer a\npractical version of WSAC and compare it with existing state-of-the-art safe\noffline RL algorithms in several continuous control environments. WSAC\noutperforms all baselines across a range of tasks, supporting the theoretical\nresults.",

Although DNN models deployed at the edge are promising for providing AI\nas a service with low latency, their cooperation is yet to be explored. In this\npaper, we consider that DNN service providers share their computing resources\nas well as their models' parameters and allow other DNNs to offload their\ncomputations without mirroring. We propose a novel algorithm called coordinated\nDNNs on edge (\\textbf{CoDE}) that facilitates coordination among DNN services\nby establishing new inference paths. CoDE aims to find the optimal path, which\nis the path with the highest possible reward, by creating multi-task DNNs from\nindividual models. The reward reflects the inference throughput and model\naccuracy. With CoDE, DNN models can make new paths for inference by using their\nown or other models' parameters. We then evaluate the performance of CoDE\nthrough numerical experiments. The results demonstrate a $40\\%$ increase in the\ninference throughput while degrading the average accuracy by only $2.3\\%$.\nExperiments show that CoDE enhances the inference throughput and, achieves\nhigher precision compared to a state-of-the-art existing method.",

Sharding boosts blockchain scalability by dividing its\nnodes into parallel shards, yet it's vulnerable to the $1\\%$ attacks where\ndishonest nodes target a shard to corrupt the entire blockchain. Balancing\nsecurity with scalability is pivotal for such systems. Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) adeptly handles dynamic, complex systems and multi-dimensional\noptimization.

Concurrently graph neural network\nexplanation approaches are being invented to uncover relationships between the\nnodes of the graphs. However, there is a disparity between the existing\nattribution methods, and it is unclear which attribution to trust. Therefore\nresearch has introduced evaluation experiments that assess them from different\nperspectives. In this work, we assess attribution methods from a perspective\nnot previously explored in the graph domain: retraining. The core idea is to\nretrain the network on important (or not important) relationships as identified\nby the attributions and evaluate how networks can generalize based on these\nrelationships. We reformulate the retraining framework to sidestep issues\nlurking in the previous formulation and propose guidelines for correct\nanalysis. We run our analysis on four state-of-the-art GNN attribution methods\nand five synthetic and real-world graph classification datasets. The analysis\nreveals that attributions perform variably depending on the dataset and the\nnetwork. Most importantly, we observe that the famous GNNExplainer performs\nsimilarly to an arbitrary designation of edge importance. The study concludes\nthat the retraining evaluation cannot be used as a generalized benchmark and\nrecommends it as a toolset to evaluate attributions on a specifically addressed\nnetwork, dataset, and sparsity.",

                "summary": "Accounting for exposure measurement errors has been recognized as a crucial\nproblem in environmental epidemiology for over two decades. Bayesian\nhierarchical models offer a coherent probabilistic framework for evaluating\nassociations between environmental exposures and health effects, which take\ninto account exposure measurement errors introduced by uncertainty in the\nestimated exposure as well as spatial misalignment between the exposure and\nhealth outcome data. While two-stage Bayesian analyses are often regarded as a\ngood alternative to fully Bayesian analyses when joint estimation is not\nfeasible, there has been minimal research on how to properly propagate\nuncertainty from the first-stage exposure model to the second-stage health\nmodel, especially in the case of a large number of participant locations along\nwith spatially correlated exposures. We propose a scalable two-stage Bayesian\napproach, called a sparse multivariate normal (sparse MVN) prior approach,\nbased on the Vecchia approximation for assessing associations between exposure\nand health outcomes in environmental epidemiology. We compare its performance\nwith existing approaches through simulation. Our sparse MVN prior approach\nshows comparable performance with the fully Bayesian approach, which is a gold\nstandard but is impossible to implement in some cases. We investigate the\nassociation between source-specific exposures and pollutant (nitrogen dioxide\n(NO$_2$))-specific exposures and birth outcomes for 2012 in Harris County,\nTexas, using several approaches, including the newly developed method.",

This is a family $\\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)$ of flat\nconnections on a trivial vector bundle on $X$ depending linearly on parameters\n$s_1,...,s_n$ and generically invariant, up to isomorphism, under the shifts\n$s_i\\mapsto s_i+1$ for all $i$. If in addition $\\nabla$ has regular\nsingularities, we call it a quasi-motivic pencil. We use tools from complex\nanalysis to establish various remarkable properties of such pencils over\n$\\mathbb C$. For example, we show that the monodromy of a quasi-motivic pencil\nis defined over the field of algebraic functions in $e^{2\\pi is_j}$, and that\nits singularities are constrained to an arrangement of hyperplanes with integer\nnormal vectors. Then we show that many important examples of families of flat\nconnections, such as Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov, Dunkl, and Casimir connections,\nare quasi-motivic and thus periodic pencils.\n  Besides being interesting in its own right, the periodic property of a pencil\nof flat connections turns out to be very useful in computing the eigenvalues of\nthe $p$-curvature of its reduction to positive characteristic.

However, the dynamic response of the click\nmechanism of the nonlinear robot system with multiple stability still unclear.\nIn this paper, a novel dipteran robot model with click mechanism proposed based\non the multiple stability of snap-through buckling. The motion of equation of\nthe nonlinear flight robot system is obtained by using the Euler-Lagrange\nequation. The nonlinear potential energy, the elastic force, equilibrium\nbifurcation, as well as equilibrium stability are investigated to show the\nmultiple stability characteristics. The transient sets of bifurcation and\npersistent set of regions in the system parameter plane and the corresponding\nphase portraits are obtained with multiple stability of single and double well\nbehaviors. Then, the periodic free vibration response are defined by the\nanalytical solution of three kinds of elliptical functions, as well as the\namplitude frequency responses are investigated by numerical integration. Based\non the topological equivalent method, the chaotic thresholds of the homo-clinic\norbits for the chaotic vibration of harmonic forced robot system are derived to\nshow the chaotic parametric condition. Finally, the prototype of nonlinear\nflapping robot is manufactured and the experimental system is setup. The\nnonlinear static moment of force curves, periodic response and dynamic flight\nvibration of dipteran robot system are carried out.

                "summary": "Relative pose estimation for RGBD cameras is crucial in a number of\napplications. Previous approaches either rely on the RGB aspect of the images\nto estimate pose thus not fully making use of depth in the estimation process\nor estimate pose from the 3D cloud of points that each image produces, thus not\nmaking full use of RGB information. This paper shows that if one pair of\ncorrespondences is hypothesized from the RGB-based ranked-ordered\ncorrespondence list, then the space of remaining correspondences is restricted\nto corresponding pairs of curves nested around the hypothesized correspondence,\nimplicitly capturing depth consistency. This simple Geometric Depth Constraint\n(GDC) significantly reduces potential matches. In effect this becomes a filter\non possible correspondences that helps reduce the number of outliers and thus\nexpedites RANSAC significantly. As such, the same budget of time allows for\nmore RANSAC iterations and therefore additional robustness and a significant\nspeedup. In addition, the paper proposed a Nested RANSAC approach that also\nspeeds up the process, as shown through experiments on TUM, ICL-NUIM, and RGBD\nScenes v2 datasets.",

The unique\ncharacteristics of time-dependent data, such as high dimensionality and\ncorrelation in model outputs requires special attention in the IUQ process. By\nintegrating Gaussian Processes (GP) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we\nefficiently construct surrogate models that effectively handle the complexity\nof dynamic TH systems. Additionally, we incorporate Neural Network (NN) models\nfor time series regression, enhancing the computational accuracy and\nfacilitating derivative calculations for efficient posterior sampling using the\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo Method - No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of this hierarchical Bayesian approach using\nthe transient experiments in the PSBT benchmark. Our results show improved\nestimates of Physical Model Parameters' posterior distributions and a reduced\ntendency for over-fitting, compared to conventional single-level Bayesian\nmodels. This approach offers a promising framework for extending IUQ to more\ncomplex, time-dependent problems.",

As natural language processing has advanced with transformer-based\nlanguage models, many language models that learn characteristics of nucleotide\nsequences have also emerged. These models show good performance in classifying\nvarious features of nucleotide sequences. When classifying nucleotide\nsequences, not only the sequence itself, but also various background knowledge\nis utilized. In this study, we use not only a nucleotide sequence-based\nlanguage model but also a text language model based on PubMed articles to\nreflect more biological background knowledge in the model. We propose a method\nto fine-tune the nucleotide sequence language model and the text language model\nbased on various databases of antibiotic resistance genes. We also propose an\nLLM-based augmentation technique to supplement the data and an ensemble method\nto effectively combine the two models. We also propose a benchmark for\nevaluating the model. Our method achieved better performance than the\nnucleotide sequence language model in the drug resistance class prediction.",

                "title": "DEWP: Deep Expansion Learning for Wind Power Forecasting",
                "summary": "Wind is one kind of high-efficient, environmentally-friendly and\ncost-effective energy source. Wind power, as one of the largest renewable\nenergy in the world, has been playing a more and more important role in\nsupplying electricity. Though growing dramatically in recent years, the amount\nof generated wind power can be directly or latently affected by multiple\nuncertain factors, such as wind speed, wind direction, temperatures, etc. More\nimportantly, there exist very complicated dependencies of the generated power\non the latent composition of these multiple time-evolving variables, which are\nalways ignored by existing works and thus largely hinder the prediction\nperformances. To this end, we propose DEWP, a novel Deep Expansion learning for\nWind Power forecasting framework to carefully model the complicated\ndependencies with adequate expressiveness. DEWP starts with a stack-by-stack\narchitecture, where each stack is composed of (i) a variable expansion block\nthat makes use of convolutional layers to capture dependencies among multiple\nvariables; (ii) a time expansion block that applies Fourier series and\nbackcast/forecast mechanism to learn temporal dependencies in sequential\npatterns. These two tailored blocks expand raw inputs into different latent\nfeature spaces which can model different levels of dependencies of\ntime-evolving sequential data. Moreover, we propose an inference block\ncorresponding for each stack, which applies multi-head self-attentions to\nacquire attentive features and maps expanded latent representations into\ngenerated wind power. In addition, to make DEWP more expressive in handling\ndeep neural architectures, we adapt doubly residue learning to process\nstack-by-stack outputs. Finally, we present extensive experiments in the\nreal-world wind power forecasting application on two datasets from two\ndifferent turbines to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

                "summary": "We present magnetostriction and thermal expansion measurements on\nmultiferroic (Ni0.93Co0.07)3V2O8. The high field phase diagrams up to 33 T\nalong the a, b and c directions are built. For H//a, as the magnetic field\nincreases, two intermediate phases appear between the incommensurate phase and\nthe paramagnetic phase at about 7 K, and then a magnetically induced phase\nappears above the paramagnetic phase. For H//b,thermal expansion measurement\nindicates a mutation in the spin lattice coupling of the high field phases. The\ninterlaced phase boundary suggests a mixed state in the optical high field\nphase. For H//c, an intermediate phase between the commensurate phase and the\nincommensurate phase is detected. A nonlinear boundary between the intermediate\nphase and the low temperature incommensurate phase, and a clear boundary\nbetween the commensurate phase and the paramagnetic phase are found. These\nresults indicate that doping Co2+ breaks the weak ferromagnetic moment of the\ncommensurate phase, which exists in the parent compound Ni3V2O8 and\n(Ni0.9Co0.1)3V2O8. This nonlinear influence reflects complicated spin\nmodulation in Ni3V2O8 by doping Co2+.",

Here, we demonstrate an effective strategy to modulate the\nthermal transport property of hybrid perovskites by halide alloying. A highly\ntunable thermal conductivity of mixed-halide hybrid perovskites is achieved due\nto halide-alloying and structural distortion. Our experimental measurements\nshow that the room temperature thermal conductivity of MAPb(BrxI1-x)3 (x = 0-1)\ncan be largely modulated from 0.27 W/mK (x = 0.5) to 0.47 W/mK (x = 1).\nMolecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that the thermal\nconductivity reduction of hybrid halide perovskites results from the\nsuppression of the mean free paths of the low-frequency acoustic and optical\nphonons. It is found that halide alloying and the induced structural distortion\ncan largely increase the scatterings of optical and acoustic phonons,\nrespectively. The confined diffusion of MA+ cations in the octahedra cage is\nfound to act as an additional thermal transport channel in hybrid perovskites\nand can contribute around 10-20% of the total thermal conductivity. Our\nfindings provide a strategy for tailoring the thermal transport in hybrid\nhalide perovskites which may largely benefit their related applications.",

The absence of contract specifications\nposes a real challenge to the correctness verification of smart contracts.\nProgram invariants are properties that are always preserved throughout the\nexecution, which characterize an important aspect of the program behaviors. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel invariant generation framework, INVCON+, for\nSolidity smart contracts. INVCON+ extends the existing invariant detector,\nInvCon, to automatically produce verified contract invariants based on both\ndynamic inference and static verification. Unlike INVCON+, InvCon only produces\nlikely invariants, which have a high probability to hold, yet are still not\nverified against the contract code. Particularly, INVCON+ is able to infer more\nexpressive invariants that capture richer semantic relations of contract code.\nWe evaluate INVCON+ on 361 ERC20 and 10 ERC721 real-world contracts, as well as\ncommon ERC20 vulnerability benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that\nINVCON+ efficiently produces high-quality invariant specifications, which can\nbe used to secure smart contracts from common vulnerabilities.",

According to the topology\nproperties (e.g., structural roles and community memberships of nodes) to be\npreserved, it can be categorized into the identity and position embedding. Most\nexisting methods can only capture one type of property. Some approaches can\nsupport the inductive inference that generalizes the embedding model to new\nnodes or graphs but relies on the availability of attributes. Due to the\ncomplicated correlations between topology and attributes, it is unclear for\nsome inductive methods which type of property they can capture. In this study,\nwe explore a unified framework for the joint inductive inference of identity\nand position embeddings without attributes. An inductive random walk embedding\n(IRWE) method is proposed, which combines multiple attention units to handle\nthe random walk (RW) on graph topology and simultaneously derives identity and\nposition embeddings that are jointly optimized. We demonstrate that some RW\nstatistics can characterize node identities and positions while supporting the\ninductive inference. Experiments validate the superior performance of IRWE over\nvarious baselines for the transductive and inductive inference of identity and\nposition embeddings.",

At the core\nof the method is a new generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization procedure that\nrecursively constructs orthonormal bases for a sequence of RKHS-restricted\nKrylov subspaces.

Incorrect parameter selection can significantly hinder ADMM's\nconvergence rate. To address this challenge, in this paper we first propose a\ngeneral approach to optimize the value of penalty parameter, followed by a\nnovel closed-form formula to compute the optimal relaxation parameter in the\ncontext of linear quadratic problems (LQPs).

                "summary": "In this paper, given a user's query set and a budget limit, we aim to help\nthe user assemble a set of datasets that can enrich a base dataset by\nintroducing the maximum number of distinct tuples (i.e., maximizing\ndistinctiveness). We prove this problem to be NP-hard and, subsequently, we\ndevelop a greedy algorithm that attains an approximation ratio of (1-e^{-1})/2.\nHowever, this algorithm lacks efficiency and scalability due to its frequent\ncomputation of the exact distinctiveness marginal gain of any candidate dataset\nfor selection, which requires scanning through every tuple in candidate\ndatasets and thus is unaffordable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose an efficient machine learning (ML)-based method for estimating the\ndistinctiveness marginal gain of any candidate dataset. This effectively\neliminates the need to test each tuple individually. Estimating the\ndistinctiveness marginal gain of a dataset involves estimating the number of\ndistinct tuples in the tuple sets returned by each query in a query set across\nmultiple datasets. This can be viewed as the cardinality estimation for a query\nset on a set of datasets, and the proposed method is the first to tackle this\ncardinality estimation problem. This is a significant advancement over prior\nmethods that were limited to single-query cardinality estimation on a single\ndataset and struggled with identifying overlaps among tuple sets returned by\neach query in a query set across multiple datasets. Extensive experiments using\nfive real-world data pools demonstrate that our algorithm, which utilizes\nML-based distinctiveness estimation, outperforms all relevant baselines in both\neffectiveness and efficiency.",

The gluon distribution is\nobtained from the Golec-Biernat-W$\\ddot{\\mathrm{u}}$sthoff (GBW) and Bartels,\nGolec-Biernat and Kowalski (BGK )models. The main elements are based on the\ncolor dipole picture (CDP) and the generalized double asymptotic scaling (DAS)\napproach for usual parton distribution functions (PDFs). The comparisons with\nthe HERA data are made and predictions for the proposed LHeC and FCC-he\ncolliders are also provided in a wide range of the transverse separation $r$.\nIn particular, the ratio $R^{h}=F_{L}^{h}/F_{2}^{h}, h=c,b,t$ is well described\nby the dipole models and is sensitive to the collider energies from HERA until\nFCC-he. We derive correlated bounds on the ratio $F^{c}_{2}/F_{2}$ and\n$F^{b}_{2}/F_{2}$ and compared them with the BGK and IP-sat models. The\nuncertainties are due to the renormalization and factorization scales at large\nand low $r$ values. The Sudakov form factor into the heavy quark structure\nfunctions is incorporated and the results are considered, which are dependent\non the hard scale in a wide range of the transverse separation $r$.",

                "summary": "With the increasing number of fast-electric vehicle charging stations\n(fast-EVCSs) and the popularization of information technology, electricity\nprice competition between fast-EVCSs is highly expected, in which the\nutilization of public and/or privacy-preserved information will play a crucial\nrole. Self-interest electric vehicle (EV) users, on the other hand, try to\nselect a fast-EVCS for charging in a way to maximize their utilities based on\nelectricity price, estimated waiting time, and their state of charge. While\nexisting studies have largely focused on finding equilibrium prices, this study\nproposes a personalized dynamic pricing policy (PeDP) for a fast-EVCS to\nmaximize revenue using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We first propose\na multiple fast-EVCSs competing simulation environment to model the selfish\nbehavior of EV users using a game-based charging station selection model with a\nmonetary utility function. In the environment, we propose a Q-learning-based\nPeDP to maximize fast-EVCS' revenue. Through numerical simulations based on the\nenvironment: (1) we identify the importance of waiting time in the EV charging\nmarket by comparing the classic Bertrand competition model with the proposed\nPeDP for fast-EVCSs (from the system perspective); (2) we evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed PeDP and analyze the effects of the information on\nthe policy (from the service provider perspective); and (3) it can be seen that\nprivacy-preserved information sharing can be misused by artificial\nintelligence-based PeDP in a certain situation in the EV charging market (from\nthe customer perspective).",

                "summary": "Automatic recognition of dysarthric speech remains a highly challenging task\nto date. Neuro-motor conditions and co-occurring physical disabilities create\ndifficulty in large-scale data collection for ASR system development. Adapting\nSSL pre-trained ASR models to limited dysarthric speech via data-intensive\nparameter fine-tuning leads to poor generalization. To this end, this paper\npresents an extensive comparative study of various data augmentation approaches\nto improve the robustness of pre-trained ASR model fine-tuning to dysarthric\nspeech. These include: a) conventional speaker-independent perturbation of\nimpaired speech; b) speaker-dependent speed perturbation, or GAN-based\nadversarial perturbation of normal, control speech based on their time\nalignment against parallel dysarthric speech; c) novel Spectral basis GAN-based\nadversarial data augmentation operating on non-parallel data. Experiments\nconducted on the UASpeech corpus suggest GAN-based data augmentation\nconsistently outperforms fine-tuned Wav2vec2.0 and HuBERT models using no data\naugmentation and speed perturbation across different data expansion operating\npoints by statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions up to\n2.01% and 0.96% absolute (9.03% and 4.63% relative) respectively on the\nUASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers.

                "summary": "The recent transformer-based models have dominated the Referring Video Object\nSegmentation (RVOS) task due to the superior performance. Most prior works\nadopt unified DETR framework to generate segmentation masks in\nquery-to-instance manner. In this work, we integrate strengths of that leading\nRVOS models to build up an effective paradigm. We first obtain binary mask\nsequences from the RVOS models. To improve the consistency and quality of\nmasks, we propose Two-Stage Multi-Model Fusion strategy. Each stage rationally\nensembles RVOS models based on framework design as well as training strategy,\nand leverages different video object segmentation (VOS) models to enhance mask\ncoherence by object propagation mechanism. Our method achieves 75.7% J&F on\nRef-Youtube-VOS validation set and 70% J&F on test set, which ranks 1st place\non 5th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge (ICCV 2023) track 3.\nCode is available at https://github.com/RobertLuo1/iccv2023_RVOS_Challenge.",

Under some common\nregularity conditions, we show -- perhaps for the first time -- that SAA's\nsample complexity can be completely free from any quantification of metric\nentropy (such as the logarithm of the covering number), leading to a\nsignificantly more efficient rate with dimensionality $d$ than most existing\nresults. From the newly established complexity bounds, an important revelation\nis that SAA and the canonical stochastic mirror descent (SMD) method, two\nmainstream solution approaches to SP, entail almost identical rates of sample\nefficiency, rectifying a persistent theoretical discrepancy of SAA from SMD by\nthe order of $O(d)$. Furthermore, this paper explores non-Lipschitzian\nscenarios where SAA maintains provable efficacy but the corresponding results\nfor SMD remain mostly unexplored, indicating the potential of SAA's better\napplicability in some irregular settings.",

                "summary": "Monte Carlo integration is fundamental in scientific and statistical\ncomputation, but requires reliable samples from the target distribution, which\nposes a substantial challenge in the case of multi-modal distributions.\nExisting methods often involve time-consuming tuning, and typically lack\ntailored estimators for efficient use of the samples. This paper adapts the\nWarp-U transformation [Wang et al., 2022] to form multi-modal sampling strategy\ncalled Warp-U sampling. It constructs a stochastic map to transport a\nmulti-modal density into a uni-modal one, and subsequently inverts the\ntransport but with new stochasticity injected. For efficient use of the samples\nfor normalising constant estimation, we propose (i) an unbiased estimation\nscheme based coupled chains, where the Warp-U sampling is used to reduce the\ncoupling time; and (ii) a stochastic Warp-U bridge sampling estimator, which\nimproves its deterministic counterpart given in Wang et al. [2022]. Our overall\napproach requires less tuning and is easier to apply than common alternatives.\nTheoretically, we establish the ergodicity of our sampling algorithm and that\nour stochastic Warp-U bridge sampling estimator has greater (asymptotic)\nprecision per CPU second compared to the Warp-U bridge estimator of Wang et al.\n[2022] under practical conditions. The advantages and current limitations of\nour approach are demonstrated through simulation studies and an application to\nexoplanet detection.",

                "summary": "We analyse the M31 halo and its substructure within a projected radius of 120\nkpc using a combination of Subaru/HSC NB515 and CFHT/MegaCam g- & i-bands. We\nsucceed in separating M31's halo stars from foreground contamination with\n$\\sim$ 90 \\% accuracy by using the surface gravity sensitive NB515 filter.\nBased on the selected M31 halo stars, we discover three new substructures,\nwhich associate with the Giant Southern Stream (GSS) based on their photometric\nmetallicity estimates. We also produce the distance and photometric metallicity\nestimates for the known substructures. While these quantities for the GSS are\nreproduced in our study, we find that the North-Western stream shows a steeper\ndistance gradient than found in an earlier study, suggesting that it is likely\nto have formed in an orbit closer to the Milky Way. For two streams in the\neastern halo (Stream C and D), we identify distance gradients that had not been\nresolved. Finally, we investigate the global halo photometric metallicity\ndistribution and surface brightness profile using the NB515-selected halo\nstars. We find that the surface brightness of the metal-poor and metal-rich\nhalo populations, and the all population can be fitted to a power-law profile\nwith an index of $\\alpha = -1.65 \\pm 0.02$, $-2.82\\pm0.01$, and $-2.44\\pm0.01$,\nrespectively. In contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo profile, its\nphotometric metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform with\nnonmonotonic trends with radius, suggesting that the halo population had\ninsufficient time to dynamically homogenize the accreted populations.",

                "summary": "Metabolic cybergenetics is a promising concept that interfaces gene\nexpression and cellular metabolism with computers for real-time dynamic\nmetabolic control. The focus is on control at the transcriptional level,\nserving as a means to modulate intracellular metabolic fluxes. Recent\nstrategies in this field have employed constraint-based dynamic models for\nprocess optimization, control, and estimation. However, this results in bilevel\ndynamic optimization problems, which pose considerable numerical and conceptual\nchallenges. In this study, we present an alternative hybrid physics-informed\ndynamic modeling framework for metabolic cybergenetics, aimed at simplifying\noptimization, control, and estimation tasks. By utilizing machine-learning\nsurrogates, our approach effectively embeds the physics of metabolic networks\ninto the process rates of structurally simpler macro-kinetic models coupled\nwith gene expression. These surrogates, informed by flux balance analysis, link\nthe domains of manipulatable intracellular enzymes to metabolic exchange\nfluxes. This ensures that critical knowledge captured by the system's metabolic\nnetwork is preserved. The resulting models can be integrated into metabolic\ncybergenetic schemes involving single-level optimizations. Additionally, the\nhybrid modeling approach maintains the number of system states at a necessary\nminimum, easing the burden of process monitoring and estimation. Our hybrid\nphysics-informed metabolic cybergenetic framework is demonstrated using a\ncomputational case study on the optogenetically-assisted production of\nitaconate by $\\textit{Escherichia coli}$.",

Firstly, the sparse Reverse Cuthill-McKee\nAlgorithm (RCM) is used to preprocess the linear system, and then a new\npartitioning strategy is proposed to divide the mutually orthogonal blocks into\none category, which greatly reduces computational complexity. In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical proof of the convergence of the POBK algorithm and\nanalyze its faster convergence.

Our approach is based on the continuity of the solution mapping and\nthe variational framework for mixed fractional Brownian motion. By utilizing\nthe variational representation, our problem is transformed into a qualitative\nproperty of the controlled system. In particular, the fast rough differential\nequation coincides with It\\^o SDE almost surely, which possesses a unique\ninvariant probability measure with frozen slow component.

                "summary": "Designing efficient, metal free, and in-expensive catalyst for\nelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for large scale\nclean and green energy production. Recently synthesized 1D Biphenylene\nnanoribbons (BPRs) display few exciting properties originating from the unique\nco-existence of 4, 6 and 8 coordinated carbon rings. Here, we present a first\nprinciples calculation of the electronic structure and electrocatalytic\nactivity of various sized N-BPRs (N indicates the width). The electrocatalytic\nperformance is evaluated based on several descriptors including electronic\nproperty, carrier mobility, Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta$G$_{HER}$), exchange\ncurrent density etc. The electronic properties are crucially sensitive to the\nwidth (N) of BPRs transiting it from semiconducting to metallic nature at N=18.\nThe p$_z$ orbitals of C-atoms from the central tetragonal rings are mainly\nresponsible for the decrease in band gap with increasing width. The room\ntemperature electron mobility is found to be as high as $\\sim6.3\\times$10$^4$\ncm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, while hole mobility is relatively lower in magnitude.\nGibbs free energy also depends sensitively on the width of BPRs as evident from\nthe p-band center analysis. We propose 15-BPR as the most promising candidate\nfor electrocatalytic activity with extremely small overpotential\n($\\approx$0.005 V) and a high exchange current density, much better than the\nstate-of-the-art Pt(111). A close inspection of the elementary reactions of HER\n(Volmer, Heyrovsky and Tafel) confirms Volmer-Tafel mechanism to be most\ndominant on 15-BPR with Tafel as the rate-determining step with a barrier of\n0.56 eV. The present study provides a deeper insight into the excellent HER\ncatalytic activity of a newly synthesized BPR which is inexpensive and is\nexpected to hasten experimental validation towards H$_2$ production.",

                "summary": "The dominant paradigm for end-to-end robot learning focuses on optimizing\ntask-specific objectives that solve a single robotic problem such as picking up\nan object or reaching a target position. However, recent work on high-capacity\nmodels in robotics has shown promise toward being trained on large collections\nof diverse and task-agnostic datasets of video demonstrations. These models\nhave shown impressive levels of generalization to unseen circumstances,\nespecially as the amount of data and the model complexity scale. Surgical robot\nsystems that learn from data have struggled to advance as quickly as other\nfields of robot learning for a few reasons: (1) there is a lack of existing\nlarge-scale open-source data to train models, (2) it is challenging to model\nthe soft-body deformations that these robots work with during surgery because\nsimulation cannot match the physical and visual complexity of biological\ntissue, and (3) surgical robots risk harming patients when tested in clinical\ntrials and require more extensive safety measures. This perspective article\naims to provide a path toward increasing robot autonomy in robot-assisted\nsurgery through the development of a multi-modal, multi-task,\nvision-language-action model for surgical robots. Ultimately, we argue that\nsurgical robots are uniquely positioned to benefit from general-purpose models\nand provide three guiding actions toward increased autonomy in robot-assisted\nsurgery.",

Recent research has\nrevealed significant nonreciprocal longitudinal resistance and nonlinear Hall\neffect in MnBi2Te4, an intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, induced by the\nquantum metric dipole. However, the inconsistent response with charge density\nand conflicting C3z symmetry requirement necessitate a thorough understanding\nof factors affecting the nonlinear transport measurement. This study uncovers\nan experimental factor leading to significant nonlinear transport signals in\nMnBi2Te4, attributed to gate voltage oscillation from the application of large\nalternating current. Additionally, a methodology is proposed to suppress this\neffect by individually grounding the voltage electrodes during second-harmonic\nmeasurements. The investigation underscores the critical importance of\nassessing the impact of gate voltage oscillation before determining the\nintrinsic nature of nonlinear transport in 2D material devices with an\nelectrically connected operative gate electrode.",

Inspired by Kostant's work then we deal with two questions. One\nof them is to construct the Whittaker model for the $G_l$-invariants of\nsymmetric algebra $S(\\sg_l)$ where $G_l$ is the adjoint group of $\\sg_l$ and\n$G_l$ acts on $S(\\sg_l)$ by coadjoint action, and then to classify all\nnonsingular Whittaker modules over $\\sg_l$. Another one is to describe the\nsymplectic structure of the manifold $Z\\subseteq\\ssf+\\sb_l$ of normalized\nJacobi elements. Then the Hamiltonian corresponding to a fundamental invariant\nprovides a class of hyperbolic Toda lattices.

                "summary": "Several works related to spatial crowdsourcing have been proposed in the\ndirection where the task executers are to perform the tasks within the\nstipulated deadlines. Though the deadlines are set, it may be a practical\nscenario that majority of the task executers submit the tasks as late as\npossible. This situation where the task executers may delay their task\nsubmission is termed as procrastination in behavioural economics. In many\napplications, these late submission of tasks may be problematic for task\nproviders. So here, the participating agents (both task providers and task\nexecuters) are articulated with the procrastination issue. In literature, how\nto prevent this procrastination within the deadline is not addressed in spatial\ncrowdsourcing scenario. However, in a bipartite graph setting one\nprocrastination aware scheduling is proposed but balanced job (task and job\nwill synonymously be used) distribution in different slots (also termed as\nschedules) is not considered there. In this paper, a procrastination aware\nscheduling of jobs is proliferated by proposing an (randomized) algorithm in\nspatial crowdsourcing scenario. Our algorithm ensures that balancing of jobs in\ndifferent schedules are maintained. Our scheme is compared with the existing\nalgorithm through extensive simulation and in terms of balancing effect, our\nproposed algorithm outperforms the existing one. Analytically it is shown that\nour proposed algorithm maintains the balanced distribution.",

Particularly for long acquisitions, feature extraction\nmust be fully automatized without human intervention and resilient to\nperturbations without increasing significantly the computational cost of a\nclassifier. In this study, we investigate on the relative resistance and\ncurrent modulation of a 24-dimensional conductimetric electronic nose, which\nuses the exponential moving average as a floating reference in a low-cost\ninformation descriptor for environment recognition. In particular, we\nidentified that depending on the structure of a linear classifier, the 'modema'\ndescriptor is optimized for different material sensing elements' contributions\nto classify information patterns. The low-pass filtering optimization leads to\nopposite behaviors between unsupervised and supervised learning: the latter one\nfavors longer integration of the reference, allowing to recognize five\ndifferent classes over 90%, while the first one prefers using the latest events\nas its reference to clusterize patterns by environment nature.

                "summary": "Space AI has become increasingly important and sometimes even necessary for\ngovernment, businesses, and society. An active research topic under this\nmission is integrating federated learning (FL) with satellite communications\n(SatCom) so that numerous low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can collaboratively\ntrain a machine learning model. However, the special communication environment\nof SatCom leads to a very slow FL training process up to days and weeks. This\npaper proposes NomaFedHAP, a novel FL-SatCom approach tailored to LEO\nsatellites, that (1) utilizes high-altitude platforms (HAPs) as distributed\nparameter servers (PS) to enhance satellite visibility, and (2) introduces\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into LEO to enable fast and\nbandwidth-efficient model transmissions. In addition, NomaFedHAP includes (3) a\nnew communication topology that exploits HAPs to bridge satellites among\ndifferent orbits to mitigate the Doppler shift, and (4) a new FL model\naggregation scheme that optimally balances models between different orbits and\nshells. Moreover, we (5) derive a closed-form expression of the outage\nprobability for satellites in near and far shells, as well as for the entire\nsystem. Our extensive simulations have validated the mathematical analysis and\ndemonstrated the superior performance of NomaFedHAP in achieving fast and\nefficient FL model convergence with high accuracy as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art.",

For a lifetime longer than $1\\,{\\rm sec}$, most of the injected\nneutrinos directly contribute to the protons-to-neutrons conversion. In both\ncases, deuterium and helium abundances are enhanced, while the constraint from\nthe deuterium is stronger than that from the helium. $^7{\\rm Li}$ abundance\ngets decreased as a consequence of additional neutrons, but the parameter range\nthat fits the observed $^7{\\rm Li}$ abundance is excluded by the deuterium\nconstraint.

Community structure is a\ncommon property observed in empirical networks in various domains. Stochastic\nblock models have been employed to investigate community structure in networks.\nNode attribute data, often accompanying network data, has been found to\npotentially enhance the learning of community structure in dyadic networks. In\nthis study, we develop a statistical framework that incorporates node attribute\ndata into the learning of community structure in a hypergraph, employing a\nstochastic block model. We demonstrate that our model, which we refer to as\nHyperNEO, enhances the learning of community structure in synthetic and\nempirical hypergraphs when node attributes are sufficiently associated with the\ncommunities. Furthermore, we found that applying a dimensionality reduction\nmethod, UMAP, to the learned representations obtained using stochastic block\nmodels, including our model, maps nodes into a two-dimensional vector space\nwhile largely preserving community structure in empirical hypergraphs. We\nexpect that our framework will broaden the investigation and understanding of\nhigher-order community structure in real-world complex systems.",

In this study, we\nuse sentiment analysis for studying selected chapters of the Bible. These\nchapters are known as the Sermon on the Mount. We utilize a pre-trained\nlanguage model for sentiment analysis by reviewing five translations of the\nSermon on the Mount, which include the King James version, the New\nInternational Version, the New Revised Standard Version, the Lamsa Version, and\nthe Basic English Version. We provide a chapter-by-chapter and verse-by-verse\ncomparison using sentiment and semantic analysis and review the major\nsentiments expressed. Our results highlight the varying sentiments across the\nchapters and verses. We found that the vocabulary of the respective\ntranslations is significantly different.

                "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive\ninstruction-following capabilities, it is still unclear whether and to what\nextent they can respond to explicit constraints that might be entailed in\nvarious instructions. As a significant aspect of LLM alignment, it is thus\nimportant to formulate such a specialized set of instructions as well as\ninvestigate the resulting behavior of LLMs. To address this vacancy, we propose\na new benchmark CoDI-Eval to systematically and comprehensively evaluate LLMs'\nresponses to instructions with various constraints. We construct a large\ncollection of constraints-attributed instructions as a test suite focused on\nboth generalization and coverage. Specifically, we advocate an instruction\ndiversification process to synthesize diverse forms of constraint expression\nand also deliberate the candidate task taxonomy with even finer-grained\nsub-categories. Finally, we automate the entire evaluation process to\nfacilitate further developments. Different from existing studies on\ncontrollable text generation, CoDI-Eval extends the scope to the prevalent\ninstruction-following paradigm for the first time. We provide extensive\nevaluations of representative LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Vicuna) on CoDI-Eval,\nrevealing their limitations in following instructions with specific constraints\nand there is still a significant gap between open-source and commercial\nclosed-source LLMs. We believe this benchmark will facilitate research into\nimproving the controllability of LLMs' responses to instructions.

We show that the resulting estimator\nsatisfies an oracle inequality that allows for model mis-specification. In the\nwell-specified setting, by choosing the learning rate carefully across three\ndistinct stages of training, we demonstrate that its risk is minimax optimal in\nterms of the dependence on the dimensionality of the data and the size of the\ntraining sample.

This\npaper investigates self-supervised learning (SSL) as an alternative to the\nstandard supervised pre-training on ImageNet data for scenarios with limited\ntraining data using the ResNet-50 deep learning model. We first demonstrate\nthat SSL pre-training on ImageNet (via the Barlow Twins SSL algorithm)\noutperforms supervised pre-training (SL) using a skin lesion dataset with\nlimited training samples. We then consider further SSL pre-training (of the two\nImageNet pre-trained models) on task-specific datasets, where our\nimplementation is motivated by supervised transfer learning. The SSL\nsignificantly enhances initially SL pre-trained models, closing the performance\ngap with initially SSL pre-trained ones. Surprisingly, further pre-training on\njust the limited fine-tuning data achieves this performance equivalence. We\nimplement a linear probe training strategy in the RestNet-50 model, and our\nexperiments reveal that improvement stems from enhanced feature extraction. We\nfind that minimal further SSL pre-training on task-specific data can be as\neffective as large-scale SSL pre-training on ImageNet for medical image\nclassification tasks with limited labelled data. We validate these results on\nan oral cancer histopathology dataset, suggesting broader applicability across\nmedical imaging domains facing labelled data scarcity.",

                "summary": "Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) has achieved resounding success by\nleveraging unlabeled data to improve detection performance. However, in Open\nScene Semi-Supervised Object Detection (O-SSOD), unlabeled data may contains\nunknown objects not observed in the labeled data, which will increase\nuncertainty in the model's predictions for known objects. It is detrimental to\nthe current methods that mainly rely on self-training, as more uncertainty\nleads to the lower localization and classification precision of pseudo labels.\nTo this end, we propose Credible Teacher, an end-to-end framework. Credible\nTeacher adopts an interactive teaching mechanism using flexible labels to\nprevent uncertain pseudo labels from misleading the model and gradually reduces\nits uncertainty through the guidance of other credible pseudo labels. Empirical\nresults have demonstrated our method effectively restrains the adverse effect\ncaused by O-SSOD and significantly outperforms existing counterparts.",

Three-dimensional\nradiation-hydrodynamic (3D RHD) ``box-in-a-star'' simulations of stellar\natmospheres offer a more realistic representation of surface convection\noccurring in late-type stars compared to traditional one-dimensional (1D)\nhydrostatic models. As evident from a multitude of observational tests, the\ncoupling of 3D RHD models with line-formation in non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (non-LTE) today provides a solid foundation for abundance analysis\nfor many elements. This review describes the ongoing and transformational work\nto advance the state-of-the-art and replace 1D LTE spectrum synthesis with its\n3D non-LTE counterpart. In summary:\n  1) 3D and non-LTE effects are intricately coupled and consistent modelling\nthereof is necessary for high-precision abundances, which is currently feasible\nfor individual elements in large surveys. Mean 3D (<3D>) models are not\nadequate as substitutes.\n  2) The solar abundance debate is presently dominated by choices and\nsystematic uncertainties that are not specific to 3D non-LTE modelling.\n  3) 3D non-LTE abundance corrections have a profound impact on our\nunderstanding of FGK-type stars, exoplanets, and the nucleosynthetic origins of\nthe elements.",

                "summary": "In recent years, text-to-video retrieval methods based on CLIP have\nexperienced rapid development. The primary direction of evolution is to exploit\nthe much wider gamut of visual and textual cues to achieve alignment.\nConcretely, those methods with impressive performance often design a heavy\nfusion block for sentence (words)-video (frames) interaction, regardless of the\nprohibitive computation complexity. Nevertheless, these approaches are not\noptimal in terms of feature utilization and retrieval efficiency. To address\nthis issue, we adopt multi-granularity visual feature learning, ensuring the\nmodel's comprehensiveness in capturing visual content features spanning from\nabstract to detailed levels during the training phase. To better leverage the\nmulti-granularity features, we devise a two-stage retrieval architecture in the\nretrieval phase. This solution ingeniously balances the coarse and fine\ngranularity of retrieval content. Moreover, it also strikes a harmonious\nequilibrium between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, in\ntraining phase, we design a parameter-free text-gated interaction block (TIB)\nfor fine-grained video representation learning and embed an extra Pearson\nConstraint to optimize cross-modal representation learning. In retrieval phase,\nwe use coarse-grained video representations for fast recall of top-k\ncandidates, which are then reranked by fine-grained video representations.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness. Notably, our method achieves comparable performance with the\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods while being nearly 50 times faster.",

                "summary": "Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected graph and $d_{G}(u,v)$ be the shortest distance\nbetween the vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$. A set\n$S=\\{s_{1},s_{2},\\cdots,s_{n}\\}\\subset V(G)$ is said to be a {\\em resolving\nset} if for all distinct vertices $u,v$ of $G$, there exist an element $s\\in S$\nsuch that $d(s,u)\\neq d(s,v)$. The minimum cardinality of a resolving set for a\ngraph $G$ is called the {\\em metric dimension} of $G$ and it is denoted by\n$\\beta{(G)}$. A resolving set having $\\beta{(G)}$ number of vertices is named\nas {\\em metric basis} of $G$. The metric dimension problem is to find a metric\nbasis in a graph $G$, and it has several real-life applications in network\ntheory, telecommunication, image processing, pattern recognition, and many\nother fields. In this article, we consider {\\em cube of trees} $T^{3}=(V, E)$,\nwhere any two vertices $u,v$ are adjacent if and only if the distance between\nthem is less than equal to three in $T$. We establish the necessary and\nsufficient conditions of a vertex subset of $V$ to become a resolving set for\n$T^{3}$. This helps determine the tight bounds (upper and lower) for the metric\ndimension of $T^{3}$. Then, for certain well-known cubes of trees, such as\ncaterpillars, lobsters, spiders, and $d$-regular trees, we establish the\nboundaries of the metric dimension. Further, we characterize some restricted\nfamilies of cube of trees satisfying $\\beta{(T^{3})}=\\beta{(T)}$. We provide a\nconstruction showing the existence of a cube of tree attaining every positive\ninteger value as their metric dimension.",

We test MOND using two independent\nmethods. The first method involves comparing the dynamical MOND mass and\nbaryonic mass, while the second method entails a comparison of the\nMOND-estimated temperature with the observed temperature. We then compare the\nunseen mass predicted by Emergent Gravity with the estimated dark matter mass.\nWe find that MOND shows a mass discrepancy in the central regions at high\nsignificance levels. The observed temperature profile is in marginal\ndisagreement with that in the MOND paradigm. However, the Emergent Gravity\nTheory agrees in accurately accounting for the dynamical mass in the inner\nregions within $1\\sigma$.

                "summary": "Nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) is an important prior that has been\nsuccessfully applied in multi-dimensional data processing tasks, e.g., image\nand video recovery. However, existing NSS-based methods are solely suitable for\nmeshgrid data such as images and videos, but are not suitable for emerging\noff-meshgrid data, e.g., point cloud and climate data. In this work, we revisit\nthe NSS from the continuous representation perspective and propose a novel\nContinuous Representation-based NonLocal method (termed as CRNL), which has two\ninnovative features as compared with classical nonlocal methods. First, based\non the continuous representation, our CRNL unifies the measure of\nself-similarity for on-meshgrid and off-meshgrid data and thus is naturally\nsuitable for both of them. Second, the nonlocal continuous groups can be more\ncompactly and efficiently represented by the coupled low-rank function\nfactorization, which simultaneously exploits the similarity within each group\nand across different groups, while classical nonlocal methods neglect the\nsimilarity across groups. This elaborately designed coupled mechanism allows\nour method to enjoy favorable performance over conventional NSS methods in\nterms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive multi-dimensional data\nprocessing experiments on-meshgrid (e.g., image inpainting and image denoising)\nand off-meshgrid (e.g., climate data prediction and point cloud recovery)\nvalidate the versatility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our CRNL as compared\nwith state-of-the-art methods.",

In theory, we\nshow tighter bounds for a class of existing practical integer sort algorithms,\nwhich provides a solid theoretical foundation for their widespread usage in\npractice and strong performance. In practice, we design a new integer sorting\nalgorithm, \\textsf{DovetailSort}, that is theoretically-efficient and has good\npractical performance.\n  In particular, \\textsf{DovetailSort} overcomes a common challenge in existing\nparallel integer sorting algorithms, which is the difficulty of detecting and\ntaking advantage of duplicate keys. The key insight in \\textsf{DovetailSort} is\nto combine algorithmic ideas from both integer- and comparison-sorting\nalgorithms. In our experiments, \\textsf{DovetailSort} achieves competitive or\nbetter performance than existing state-of-the-art parallel integer and\ncomparison sorting algorithms on various synthetic and real-world datasets.",

However, achieving multi-attribute controllable and\nrealistic 3D human avatar generation is still challenging due to feature\ncoupling and the scarcity of realistic 3D human avatar datasets. To address\nthese issues, we propose Text2Avatar, which can generate realistic-style 3D\navatars based on the coupled text prompts. Text2Avatar leverages a discrete\ncodebook as an intermediate feature to establish a connection between text and\navatars, enabling the disentanglement of features. Furthermore, to alleviate\nthe scarcity of realistic style 3D human avatar data, we utilize a pre-trained\nunconditional 3D human avatar generation model to obtain a large amount of 3D\navatar pseudo data, which allows Text2Avatar to achieve realistic style\ngeneration. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate\nrealistic 3D avatars from coupled textual data, which is challenging for other\nexisting methods in this field.",

                "summary": "In planar superconductor thin films, the places of nucleation and\narrangements of moving vortices are determined by structural defects. However,\nvarious applications of superconductors require reconfigurable steering of\nfluxons, which is hard to realize with geometrically predefined vortex pinning\nlandscapes. Here, on the basis of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation,\nwe present an approach for steering of vortex chains and vortex jets in\nsuperconductor nanotubes containing a slit. The idea is based on tilting of the\nmagnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ at an angle $\\alpha$ in the plane perpendicular to\nthe axis of a nanotube carrying an azimuthal transport current. Namely, while\nat $\\alpha=0^\\circ$ vortices move paraxially in opposite directions within each\nhalf-tube, an increase of $\\alpha$ displaces the areas with the\nclose-to-maximum normal component $|B_\\mathrm{n}|$ to the\nclose(opposite)-to-slit regions, giving rise to descending (ascending) branches\nin the induced-voltage frequency spectrum $f_\\mathrm{U}(\\alpha)$. At lower $B$,\nupon reaching the critical angle $\\alpha_\\mathrm{c}$, close-to-slit vortex\nchains disappear, yielding $f_\\mathrm{U}$ of the $nf_1$-type ($n\\geq1$: an\ninteger; $f_1$: vortex nucleation frequency). At higher $B$, $f_\\mathrm{U}$ is\nlargely blurry because of multifurcations of vortex trajectories, leading to\nthe coexistence of a vortex jet with two vortex chains at $\\alpha=90^\\circ$. In\naddition to prospects for tuning of GHz-frequency spectra and steering of\nvortices as information bits, our findings lay foundations for on-demand tuning\nof vortex arrangements in 3D superconductor membranes in tilted magnetic\nfields.",

However,\nthe complexity of traffic networks has rendered traditional machine learning\nand statistical methods less effective. With the advent of artificial\nintelligence, deep learning frameworks have achieved remarkable progress across\nvarious fields and are now considered highly effective in many areas. Since\n2019, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a particularly promising\ndeep learning approach within the ITS domain, owing to their robust ability to\nmodel graph-structured data and address complex problems. Consequently, there\nhas been increasing scholarly attention to the applications of GNNs in\ntransportation, which have demonstrated excellent performance. Nevertheless,\ncurrent research predominantly focuses on traffic forecasting, with other ITS\ndomains, such as autonomous vehicles and demand prediction, receiving less\nattention. This paper aims to review the applications of GNNs across six\nrepresentative and emerging ITS research areas: traffic forecasting, vehicle\ncontrol system, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand\nprediction, and parking management. We have examined a wide range of\ngraph-related studies from 2018 to 2023, summarizing their methodologies,\nfeatures, and contributions in detailed tables and lists.

Both parameters are material-specific and physically\nrepresent the time scales of damping of precession and nutation in\nmagnetization dynamics. $\\alpha$ and $\\mathrm{I}$ can be calculated quantum\nmechanically within the framework of the torque-torque correlation model. The\nquantities required for the calculation are torque matrix elements, the real\nand imaginary parts of the Green's function and its derivatives. Here, we\ncalculate these parameters for the elemental magnets such as Fe, Co and Ni in\nan ab initio framework using density functional theory and Wannier functions.\nWe also propose a method to calculate the torque matrix elements within the\nWannier framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by comparing\nit with the experiments and the previous ab initio and empirical studies and\nshow its potential to improve our understanding of spin dynamics and to\nfacilitate the design of spintronic devices.",

                "summary": "For decades, the spectral variations of Beta Pictoris have been modelled as\nthe result of the evaporation of exocomets close to the star, termed falling\nevaporating bodies (FEBs). Resonant perturbations by a giant planet have been\nproposed to explain the dynamical origin of these stargrazers. The disk is now\nknown to harbour two giant planets, Beta Pic b and c, orbiting the star at 9.9\nau and 2.7 au. While the former almost matches the planet formerly suspected,\nthe discovery of the latter complicates the picture. We first question the\nstability of the two-planet system. Then we investigate the dynamics of a disk\nof planetesimals orbiting the star with both planets to check the validity of\nthe FEB generation mechanism. Symplectic N-body simulations are used to\ndetermine which regions of the planetesimal disk are dynamically stable. Then\nwe focus on regions where disk particles are able to reach high eccentricities\nthanks to resonant mechanisms. The first result is that the system is\ndynamically stable. Both planets may temporarily fall in 7:1 mean motion\nresonance (MMR). Then, simulations reveal that the whole region extending\nbetween ~1.5 au and ~25 au is unstable to planetary perturbations. However, a\ndisk below 1.5 au survives, which appears to constitute an active source of\nFEBs via high-order MMRs with Beta Pic c. Beta Pic b acts as a distant\nperturber that helps sustain the whole process. These simulations rule out the\npreceding FEB generation mechanism model, which placed their origin at around\n4-5 au. Conversely, FEBs are likely to originate from a region much further in\nand related to MMRs with Beta Pic c. That mechanism also appears to last\nlonger, as new planetesimals are able to continuously enter the MMRs and evolve\ntowards the FEB state. Subsequently, the physical nature of the FEBs may differ\nfrom that previously thought, and presumably may not be icy.",

                "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) technology uses small and cost-effective sensors\nfor various applications, such as Industrial IoT. However, these sensor nodes\nare powered by fixed-size batteries, which creates a trade-off between network\nperformance and long-term sustainability. Moreover, some applications require\nthe network to provide a certain level of service, such as a lower delay for\ncritical data, while ensuring the operational reliability of sensor nodes. To\naddress this energy challenge, external energy harvesting sources, such as\nsolar and wind, offer promising and eco-friendly solutions. However, the\navailable energy from a single energy source is insufficient to meet these\nrequirements. This drives the utilization of a hybrid energy harvesting\napproach, such as the integration of solar and wind energy harvesters, to\nincrease the amount of harvested energy. Nevertheless, to fully utilize the\navailable energy, which is dynamic in nature, the sensor node must adapt its\noperation to ensure sustainable operation and enhanced network performance.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a hybrid energy harvesting-based energy neutral\noperation (ENO) medium access control (MAC) protocol, called HENO-MAC, that\nallows the receiver node to harvest energy from the solar-wind harvesters and\nadapt its duty cycle accordingly. The performance of the proposed HENO-MAC was\nevaluated using the latest realistic solar and wind data for two consecutive\ndays in GreenCastalia. The simulation results demonstrate that the duty cycle\nmechanism of HENO-MAC effectively utilizes the harvested energy to achieve ENO\nand uses the available energy resources efficiently to reduce the packet delay\nfor all packets and the highest priority packet by up to 28.5% and 27.3%,\nrespectively, when compared with other existing MAC protocols.",

However, the data\nacquired by these sensors are often coarse and noisy, making them impractical\nto use directly. In this paper, we introduce an innovative Depth map denoising\nnetwork (DMDNet) based on the Denoising Implicit Image Function (DIIF) to\nreduce noise and enhance the quality of facial depth images for low-quality 3D\nFR. After generating clean depth faces using DMDNet, we further design a\npowerful recognition network called Lightweight Depth and Normal Fusion network\n(LDNFNet), which incorporates a multi-branch fusion block to learn unique and\ncomplementary features between different modalities such as depth and normal\nimages. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four distinct low-quality\ndatabases demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods.\nFurthermore, when combining DMDNet and LDNFNet, we achieve state-of-the-art\nresults on the Lock3DFace database.",

                "summary": "Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for clinical quantification,\ndisease diagnosis, treatment planning and many other applications. Both\nconvolution-based and transformer-based u-shaped architectures have made\nsignificant success in various medical image segmentation tasks. The former can\nefficiently learn local information of images while requiring much more\nimage-specific inductive biases inherent to convolution operation. The latter\ncan effectively capture long-range dependency at different feature scales using\nself-attention, whereas it typically encounters the challenges of quadratic\ncompute and memory requirements with sequence length increasing. To address\nthis problem, through integrating the merits of these two paradigms in a\nwell-designed u-shaped architecture, we propose a hybrid yet effective\nCNN-Transformer network, named BRAU-Net++, for an accurate medical image\nsegmentation task. Specifically, BRAU-Net++ uses bi-level routing attention as\nthe core building block to design our u-shaped encoder-decoder structure, in\nwhich both encoder and decoder are hierarchically constructed, so as to learn\nglobal semantic information while reducing computational complexity.\nFurthermore, this network restructures skip connection by incorporating\nchannel-spatial attention which adopts convolution operations, aiming to\nminimize local spatial information loss and amplify global\ndimension-interaction of multi-scale features. Extensive experiments on three\npublic benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses\nother state-of-the-art methods including its baseline: BRAU-Net under almost\nall evaluation metrics. We achieve the average Dice-Similarity Coefficient\n(DSC) of 82.47, 90.10, and 92.94 on Synapse multi-organ segmentation, ISIC-2018\nChallenge, and CVC-ClinicDB, as well as the mIoU of 84.01 and 88.17 on\nISIC-2018 Challenge and CVC-ClinicDB, respectively.",

                "summary": "Recent advances in ultrafast electron emission, microscopy, and diffraction\nhave demonstrated a remarkable ability to manipulate free electrons with\nquantum coherence using light beams. Here, we present a framework for exploring\nfree electron quantum number in ultrafast electron-light interactions. We\nderive an explicit Jackiw-Rebbi solution for a low-energy free electron\nwavefunction subjected to a spatiotemporally twisted laser field, resulting in\na flying topologically protected bound state with a quantum number of e/2 -\ntermed a \"half-electron\". This flying bound state is dispersion-free due to its\ntopological nature. We demonstrate the topological confinement and pair\ngeneration mechanism of half-electrons in free space, expanding their domain\nbeyond the topological states typically found in solids and photonics. This\nadvancement enhances our understanding of emulating exotic quantum and\ntopological effects with low-energy free electrons.",

Additionally, the stick\nconfiguration is more stable than the triangle configuration. We also observe\nsimilar trends in entanglement entropy and return probability, indicating their\npotential use in characterizing decoherence time.

                "summary": "The occurrence of asymmetric rolling moments in wraparound fin (WAF)\nprojectiles, even at zero free stream angle of attack, and their potential to\ninduce roll reversal and resonant instabilities has long been recognized. The\ninduced rolling moment is seen to flip sign depending on the WAF configuration\n(with concave surface leading into the roll or vice versa), and between\nsubsonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In this work, we propose a simple\nmechanism that can explain the anomalous rolling behavior of WAF projectiles in\nthe subsonic regime. By modeling the curved fin by discrete span-wise linear\nsegments, the wraparound fin can be approximated as a wing with a deflected\nwinglet, and the experimental data available in the literature for such wing\nconfigurations can be applied to the curved fin of WAF projectiles. The lifting\ncharacteristic of the curved fin can be seen to differ depending on whether the\nwingtip appears to be deflected up or down relative to the local flow incidence\nangle. Based on this differential lift between a pair of oppositely-placed\ncurved fins on a WAF rocket, it becomes possible to explain the observed sign\nof the induced rolling moment as well as its dependence on the free stream\nangle of attack for small values of the angle of attack. The physical mechanism\nfor the differential lift, and hence the induced rolling moment, can be traced\nto the span-wise location and the liftoff height of the tip vortex from the\nwraparound fin tips.",

Our\nanalysis reveals the presence of a second eclipsing, bursting neutron-star\nlow-mass X-ray binary in the central regions of the cluster, in addition to GRS\n1747-312. The new source, which we name Terzan 6 X2, is located only ~0.7\narcsec away from GRS 1747-312 in the 2021 Chandra images. The detection of a\n5.14 ks-long eclipse in the light curve of X2 at a time not predicted by the\nephemeris of GRS 1747-312 confirms that it is an unrelated source. Using the\nSuzaku light curve from 2009, which in addition to a type-I X-ray burst also\nshowed an eclipse-like feature, we constrain the orbital period to be longer\nthan 16.27 h. The 0.5-10 keV luminosities of X2 vary in the range of\n~0.24-5.9x10^34 erg/s on time scales of months to years. We have identified a\nplausible optical counterpart of X2 in HST F606W and F814W images. This star\nvaried by 2.7 mag in V_606 between epochs separated by years. In the cluster\ncolor-magnitude diagram, the variable counterpart lies in the blue-straggler\nregion when it was optically bright, about 1.1-1.7 mag above the main-sequence\nturn-off. From the orbital period-density relation of Roche-lobe filling stars\nwe find the mass-donor radius to be >0.8 Rsun.",

                "summary": "Chest X-ray imaging is a critical diagnostic tool for identifying pulmonary\ndiseases. However, manual interpretation of these images is time-consuming and\nerror-prone. Automated systems utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nhave shown promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of chest X-ray\nimage classification. While previous work has mainly focused on using feature\nmaps from the final convolution layer, there is a need to explore the benefits\nof leveraging additional layers for improved disease classification. Extracting\nrobust features from limited medical image datasets remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based multilayer\nmultimodal fusion model that emphasizes extracting features from different\nlayers and fusing them. Our disease detection model considers the\ndiscriminatory information captured by each layer. Furthermore, we propose the\nfusion of different-sized feature maps (FDSFM) module to effectively merge\nfeature maps from diverse layers. The proposed model achieves a significantly\nhigher accuracy of 97.21% and 99.60% for both three-class and two-class\nclassifications, respectively. The proposed multilayer multimodal fusion model,\nalong with the FDSFM module, holds promise for accurate disease classification\nand can also be extended to other disease classifications in chest X-ray\nimages.",

                "summary": "Existing deep-learning-based methods for nighttime video deraining rely on\nsynthetic data due to the absence of real-world paired data. However, the\nintricacies of the real world, particularly with the presence of light effects\nand low-light regions affected by noise, create significant domain gaps,\nhampering synthetic-trained models in removing rain streaks properly and\nleading to over-saturation and color shifts. Motivated by this, we introduce\nNightRain, a novel nighttime video deraining method with adaptive-rain-removal\nand adaptive-correction. Our adaptive-rain-removal uses unlabeled rain videos\nto enable our model to derain real-world rain videos, particularly in regions\naffected by complex light effects. The idea is to allow our model to obtain\nrain-free regions based on the confidence scores. Once rain-free regions and\nthe corresponding regions from our input are obtained, we can have region-based\npaired real data. These paired data are used to train our model using a\nteacher-student framework, allowing the model to iteratively learn from less\nchallenging regions to more challenging regions. Our adaptive-correction aims\nto rectify errors in our model's predictions, such as over-saturation and color\nshifts. The idea is to learn from clear night input training videos based on\nthe differences or distance between those input videos and their corresponding\npredictions. Our model learns from these differences, compelling our model to\ncorrect the errors. From extensive experiments, our method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance. It achieves a PSNR of 26.73dB, surpassing\nexisting nighttime video deraining methods by a substantial margin of 13.7%.",

                "summary": "The perfectly matched layers method is a well known truncation technique for\nits efficiency and convenience in numerical implementations of wave scattering\nproblems in unbounded domains. In this paper, we study the convergence of the\nperfectly matched layers (PML) for wave scattering from a local perturbation of\nan open waveguide in the half space above the real line, where the refractive\nindex is a function which is periodic along the axis of the waveguide and\nequals to one above a finite height. The problem is challenging due to the\nexistence of guided waves, and a typical way to deal with the difficulty is to\napply the limiting absorption principle. Based on the Floquet-Bloch transform\nand a curve deformation theory, the solution from the limiting absorption\nprinciple is rewritten as the integral of a coupled family of quasi-periodic\nproblems with respect to the quasi-periodicity parameter on a particularly\ndesigned curve. By comparing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on a straight line\nabove the locally perturbed periodic layer, we finally show that the PML method\nconverges exponentially with respect to the PML parameter. Finally, the\nnumerical examples are shown to illustrate the theoretical results.",

                "summary": "We numerically investigate the interaction between two Airy pulses\npropagating at different wavelengths. The periodically varying peak intensity\nof the soliton that emerges from stronger Airy pulse (pump pulse) leads to the\nformation of periodic temporal boundary. The relatively weaker Airy pulse\n(probe pulse) on interaction with this boundary gets partially reflected as\nwell as transmitted. As a result, the probe pulse spectrum splits into two\nparts -- the reflected pulse spectrum undergoes red shift while transmitted\npulse exhibits blue shift. The probe pulse witneses maximum reflection when\npoint of interaction lies on the intensity maxima of the emergent soliton from\npump Airy pulse. On the other hand, maximum transmission occurs when probe Airy\npulse interacts at the intensity minima of the soliton. The reflection and\ntransmission processes can be manipulated by tuning the time delay between pump\nand probe Airy pulses. In case of sufficiently intense pump pulse, the temporal\nboundary mimics the artificial optical event horizon, and the weak probe Airy\npulse is completely reflected. This phenomenon is equivalent to the temporal\nversion of total internal reflection. The time delay and truncation parameters\nplay a vital role in the interaction. The results of the study hold potential\napplications in optical manipulation and temporal waveguiding.",

In the extreme case the very large anisotropy leads to the unity of\nthe complexity growth rate and complexity itself, it means that in this case\ngetting the target state from the reference state is reachable by no effort.\nMoreover, we suggest that $\\frac{1}{M}\\frac{dC}{dt}$ is a better representation\nof system degrees of freedom rather than the complexity growth rate\n$\\frac{dC}{dt}$ and show that how it is related to inverse anisotropic\ncatalysis.

                "summary": "Constant weight codes (CWCs) and constant composition codes (CCCs) are two\nimportant classes of codes that have been studied extensively in both\ncombinatorics and coding theory for nearly sixty years. In this paper we show\nthat for {\\it all} fixed odd distances, there exist near-optimal CWCs and CCCs\nasymptotically achieving the classic Johnson-type upper bounds.\n  Let $A_q(n,w,d)$ denote the maximum size of $q$-ary CWCs of length $n$ with\nconstant weight $w$ and minimum distance $d$. One of our main results shows\nthat for {\\it all} fixed $q,w$ and odd $d$, one has\n$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{A_q(n,d,w)}{\\binom{n}{t}}=\\frac{(q-1)^t}{\\binom{w}{t}}$,\nwhere $t=\\frac{2w-d+1}{2}$. This implies the existence of near-optimal\ngeneralized Steiner systems originally introduced by Etzion, and can be viewed\nas a counterpart of a celebrated result of R\\\"odl on the existence of\nnear-optimal Steiner systems. Note that prior to our work, very little is known\nabout $A_q(n,w,d)$ for $q\\ge 3$. A similar result is proved for the maximum\nsize of CCCs.\n  We provide different proofs for our two main results, based on two\nstrengthenings of the well-known Frankl-R\\\"odl-Pippenger theorem on the\nexistence of near-optimal matchings in hypergraphs: the first proof follows by\nKahn's linear programming variation of the above theorem, and the second\nfollows by the recent independent work of Delcour-Postle, and\nGlock-Joos-Kim-K\\\"uhn-Lichev on the existence of near-optimal matchings\navoiding certain forbidden configurations.\n  We also present several intriguing open questions for future research.",

                "summary": "The structure of a network has a major effect on dynamical processes on that\nnetwork. Many studies of the interplay between network structure and dynamics\nhave focused on models of phenomena such as disease spread, opinion formation\nand changes, coupled oscillators, and random walks. In parallel to these\ndevelopments, there have been many studies of wave propagation and other\nspatially extended processes on networks. These latter studies consider metric\nnetworks, in which the edges are associated with real intervals. Metric\nnetworks give a mathematical framework to describe dynamical processes that\ninclude both temporal and spatial evolution of some quantity of interest --\nsuch as the concentration of a diffusing substance or the amplitude of a wave\n-- by using edge-specific intervals that quantify distance information between\nnodes. Dynamical processes on metric networks often take the form of partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we present a collection of\ntechniques and paradigmatic linear PDEs that are useful to investigate the\ninterplay between structure and dynamics in metric networks. We start by\nconsidering a time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation. We then use both\nfinite-difference and spectral approaches to study the Poisson, heat, and wave\nequations as paradigmatic examples of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDE\nproblems on metric networks. Our spectral approach is able to account for\ndegenerate eigenmodes. In our numerical experiments, we consider metric\nnetworks with up to about $10^4$ nodes and about $10^4$ edges. A key\ncontribution of our paper is to increase the accessibility of studying PDEs on\nmetric networks. Software that implements our numerical approaches is available\nat https://gitlab.com/ComputationalScience/metric-networks.",

In\nthis paper, we present a unified architecture for SKU search that provides both\na real-time suggestion system (based on a Trie data structure) as well as a\nlower latency search system (making use of character level TF-IDF in\ncombination with language model vector embeddings) where users initiate the\nsearch process explicitly. We carry out ablation studies that justify designing\na complex search system composed of multiple components to address the delicate\ntrade-off between speed and accuracy. Using SKU search in the Dynamics CRM as\nan example, we show how our system vastly outperforms, in all aspects, the\nresults provided by the default search engine. Finally, we show how SKU\ndescriptions may be enhanced via generative text models (using gpt-3.5-turbo)\nso that the consumers of the search results may get more context and a\ngenerally better experience when presented with the results of their SKU\nsearch.",

This enables a comprehensive\nprediction of fragmentation fractions of weakly decaying bottom hadrons for the\nfirst time and a satisfactory explanation of the existing measurements in $pp$\ncollisions at the LHC. Utilizing the bottom hadro-chemistry thus obtained as\nthe baseline, we then perform transport simulations of bottom quarks in the hot\nQCD matter created in PbPb collisions at the LHC energy and calculate the\npertinent bottom-hadron observables. The transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependent\nmodifications of the bottom baryon-to-meson ratio ($\\Lambda_b^0/B^-$) relative\nto their $pp$ counterparts are highlighted as a result of bottom quark\ndiffusion and hadronization in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).

                "summary": "The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in\nlight field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of\nconvolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area.\nNevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many\nexisting methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional\nsubspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side\neffect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a\nOne-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly\npreventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this\npaper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel\nMany-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular\ninformation in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention\nmechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all\nsub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is\nenabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With\nM2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network\nfor LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various public datasets. We further conduct\nin-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual\ninterpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly\nnon-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace\nisolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.",

However, these approaches rely on a limited set of scenarios where\nanswers can be pre-determined, diverging from genuine needs. Furthermore, a\nsole emphasis on outcomes disregards the intricate capabilities essential for\nLLMs to effectively utilize tools. To tackle this issue, we propose ToolEyes, a\nfine-grained system tailored for the evaluation of the LLMs' tool learning\ncapabilities in authentic scenarios. The system meticulously examines seven\nreal-world scenarios, analyzing five dimensions crucial to LLMs in tool\nlearning: format alignment, intent comprehension, behavior planning, tool\nselection, and answer organization. Additionally, ToolEyes incorporates a tool\nlibrary boasting approximately 600 tools, serving as an intermediary between\nLLMs and the physical world. Evaluations involving ten LLMs across three\ncategories reveal a preference for specific scenarios and limited cognitive\nabilities in tool learning. Intriguingly, expanding the model size even\nexacerbates the hindrance to tool learning. These findings offer instructive\ninsights aimed at advancing the field of tool learning.

Within this approach, we synthesized molecular semiconducting\ncesium ($\\textit P4/nmm$-CsH$_7$, $\\textit P$1-CsH$_{15+x}$) and rubidium\n(RbH$_{9-x}$) polyhydrides with a very high hydrogen content reaching 93 at%.\nPreservation of CsH$_7$ at near ambient conditions, confirmed both\nexperimentally and theoretically, represents a significant advance in the\nstabilization of hydrogen-rich compounds. In addition, we synthesized two\ncrystal modifications of RbH$_{9-x}$ with pseudo hexagonal and pseudo\ntetragonal structures identified by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman\nmeasurements. Both phases are stable at 8-10 GPa. This is an unprecedented low\nstabilization pressure for polyhydrides. These discoveries open up\npossibilities for modifying existing hydrogen storage materials to increase\ntheir efficiency.",

To navigate the harmonization between equivariance\nand expressiveness, we propose a deep learning method synergizing two distinct\ncategories of neural mechanisms as a two-stage encoding and regression\nframework. The first stage corresponds to group theory-based neural mechanisms\nwith inherent SO(3)-equivariant properties prior to the parameter learning\nprocess, while the second stage is characterized by a non-linear 3D graph\nTransformer network we propose, featuring high capability on non-linear\nexpressiveness. The novel combination lies in the point that, the first stage\npredicts baseline Hamiltonians with abundant SO(3)-equivariant features\nextracted, assisting the second stage in empirical learning of equivariance;\nand in turn, the second stage refines the first stage's output as a\nfine-grained prediction of Hamiltonians using powerful non-linear neural\nmappings, compensating for the intrinsic weakness on non-linear expressiveness\ncapability of mechanisms in the first stage. Our method enables precise,\ngeneralizable predictions while capturing SO(3)-equivariance under rotational\ntransformations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Hamiltonian\nprediction on six benchmark databases.",

                "summary": "Sensory perception originates from the responses of sensory neurons, which\nreact to a collection of sensory signals linked to various physical attributes\nof a singular perceptual object. Unraveling how the brain extracts perceptual\ninformation from these neuronal responses is a pivotal challenge in both\ncomputational neuroscience and machine learning. Here we introduce a\nstatistical mechanical theory, where perceptual information is first encoded in\nthe correlated variability of sensory neurons and then reformatted into the\nfiring rates of downstream neurons. Applying this theory, we illustrate the\nencoding of motion direction using neural covariance and demonstrate\nhigh-fidelity direction recovery by spiking neural networks. Networks trained\nunder this theory also show enhanced performance in classifying natural images,\nachieving higher accuracy and faster inference speed. Our results challenge the\ntraditional view of neural covariance as a secondary factor in neural coding,\nhighlighting its potential influence on brain function.",

In this paper, we introduce a geometric object called\nequilibrium bundle, regarding which, first, we formalize perfect equilibria of\ndynamic games as the zero points of its canonical section, second, we formalize\na hybrid iteration of dynamic programming and interior point method as a line\nsearch on it, third, we give the existence and oddness theorems of it as an\nextension of those of Nash equilibria. The line search leads to any perfect\nequilibrium of any dynamic game, it achieves a weak approximation\n(approximating to an $\\epsilon$-equilibrium) in fully polynomial time, and it\nachieves a strong approximation (approximating to an $\\epsilon$-neighborhood of\nan actual equilibrium) with dependent time complexity. Our method is an FPTAS\n(fully PTAS) for the PPAD-complete weak approximation problem of game\nequilibria, implying PPAD=FP. As intermediate results, we introduce two\nconcepts called unbiased barrier problem and unbiased KKT conditions to make\nthe interior point method to approximate Nash equilibria, and introduce a\nconcept called policy cone to give the sufficient and necessary condition for\ndynamic programming to converge to perfect equilibria. In experiment, the line\nsearch process is animated, and the method is tested on 2000 randomly generated\ndynamic games where it converges to a perfect equilibrium in every single case.",

This article introduces two\nmixture representations for the GIG: one that expresses the distribution as a\ncontinuous mixture of inverse Gaussians and another that reveals a recursive\nrelationship between GIGs with different values of $p$. The former\nrepresentation forms the basis for a data augmentation scheme that leads to a\ngeometrically ergodic Gibbs sampler for the GIG. This simple Gibbs sampler,\nwhich alternates between gamma and inverse Gaussian conditional distributions,\ncan be incorporated within an encompassing MCMC algorithm when simulation from\na GIG is required.

Starting from a\nPenrose Hubbard model, our microscopic studies suggest that the Kohn-Luttinger\nmechanism driven SC in the QC is usually gapless due to violation of Anderson's\ntheorem, rendering that both chiral and nematic SCs are common. The nematic SC\nin the QC can support novel vestigial phases driven by pairing phase\nfluctuations above its $T_c$. Our combined renormalization group and\nMonte-Carlo studies provide a phase diagram in which, besides the conventional\ncharge-4e SC, two critical vestigial phases emerge, i.e. the quasi-nematic\n(Q-N) SC and Q-N metal. In the two Q-N phases, the discrete lattice rotation\nsymmetry is counter-intuitively ``quasi-broken'' with power-law decaying\norientation correlation. They separate the phase diagram into various phases\nconnected via Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. These\nremarkable critical vestigial phases, which resemble the intermediate BKT phase\nin the $q$-state ($q\\ge 5$) clock model, are consequence of the five- (or\nhigher-) fold anisotropy field brought about by the unique QC symmetry, which\nare absent in conventional crystalline materials.",

                "summary": "Machine translation systems have been widely adopted in our daily life,\nmaking life easier and more convenient. Unfortunately, erroneous translations\nmay result in severe consequences, such as financial losses. This requires to\nimprove the accuracy and the reliability of machine translation systems.\nHowever, it is challenging to test machine translation systems because of the\ncomplexity and intractability of the underlying neural models. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a novel metamorphic testing approach by syntactic tree\npruning (STP) to validate machine translation systems. Our key insight is that\na pruned sentence should have similar crucial semantics compared with the\noriginal sentence. Specifically, STP (1) proposes a core semantics-preserving\npruning strategy by basic sentence structure and dependency relations on the\nlevel of syntactic tree representation; (2) generates source sentence pairs\nbased on the metamorphic relation; (3) reports suspicious issues whose\ntranslations break the consistency property by a bag-of-words model. We further\nevaluate STP on two state-of-the-art machine translation systems (i.e., Google\nTranslate and Bing Microsoft Translator) with 1,200 source sentences as inputs.\nThe results show that STP can accurately find 5,073 unique erroneous\ntranslations in Google Translate and 5,100 unique erroneous translations in\nBing Microsoft Translator (400% more than state-of-the-art techniques), with\n64.5% and 65.4% precision, respectively. The reported erroneous translations\nvary in types and more than 90% of them cannot be found by state-of-the-art\ntechniques. There are 9,393 erroneous translations unique to STP, which is\n711.9% more than state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, STP is quite effective\nto detect translation errors for the original sentences with a recall reaching\n74.0%, improving state-of-the-art techniques by 55.1% on average.",

                "summary": "Post-stack seismic inversion is a widely used technique to retrieve\nhigh-resolution acoustic impedance models from migrated seismic data. Its\nmodelling operator assumes that a migrated seismic data can be generated from\nthe convolution of a source wavelet and the time derivative of the acoustic\nimpedance model. Given the band-limited nature of the seismic wavelet, the\nconvolutional model acts as a filtering operator on the acoustic impedance\nmodel, thereby making the problem of retrieving acoustic impedances from\nseismic data ambiguous. In order to compensate for missing frequencies,\npost-stack seismic inversion is often regularized, meaning that prior\ninformation about the structure of the subsurface is included in the inversion\nprocess. Recently, the Plug-and-Play methodology has gained wide interest in\nthe inverse problem community as a new form of implicit regularization, often\noutperforming state-of-the-art regularization. Plug-and-Play can be applied to\nany proximal algorithm by simply replacing the proximal operator of the\nregularizer with any denoiser of choice. We propose to use Plug-and-Play\nregularization with a 2D pre-trained, deep denoiser for 2D post-stack seismic\ninversion. Additionally, we show that a generalization of Plug-and-Play, called\nMulti-Agent Consensus Equilibrium, can be adopted to solve 3D post-stack\ninversion whilst leveraging the same 2D pre-trained denoiser used in the 2D\ncase. More precisely, Multi-Agent Consensus Equilibrium combines the results of\napplying such 2D denoiser in the inline, crossline, and time directions in an\noptimal manner. We verify the proposed methods on a portion of the SEAM Phase 1\nvelocity model and the Sleipner field dataset. 1",

                "summary": "X-ray binaries are known to launch powerful accretion disk winds that can\nhave significant impact on the binary systems and their surroundings. To\nquantify the impact and determine the launching mechanisms of these outflows,\nwe need to measure the wind plasma number density, an important ingredient in\nthe theoretical disk wind models. While X-ray spectroscopy is a crucial tool to\nunderstanding the wind properties, such as their velocity and ionization, in\nnearly all cases, we lack the signal-to-noise to constrain the plasma number\ndensity, weakening the constraints on outflow location and mass outflow rate.\nWe present a new approach to determine this number density in the X-ray binary\nHercules X-1 by measuring the speed of the wind ionization response to\ntime-variable illuminating continuum. Hercules X-1 is powered by a highly\nmagnetized neutron star, pulsating with a period of 1.24 s. We show that the\nwind number density in Hercules X-1 is sufficiently high to respond to these\npulsations by modeling the ionization response with the time-dependent\nphotoionization model TPHO. We then perform a pulse-resolved analysis of the\nbest-quality XMM-Newton observation of Hercules X-1 and directly detect the\nwind response, confirming that the wind density is at least $10^{12}$\ncm$^{-3}$. Finally, we simulate XRISM observations of Hercules X-1 and show\nthat they will allow us to accurately measure the number density at different\nlocations within the outflow. With XRISM we will rule out $\\sim3$ orders of\nmagnitude in density parameter space, constraining the wind mass outflow rate,\nenergetics, and its launching mechanism.",

In this work, we\npropose the Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network (SAR-GNN) for graph\nclassification, which consists of two core modules: 1) a traditional graph\nneural network serving as the backbone for learning node features and 2) the\nGraph Neural Memory designed to distill a compact graph representation from\nnode features of the backbone. We first estimate the global node saliency by\nmeasuring the semantic similarity between the compact graph representation and\nnode features. Then the learned saliency distribution is leveraged to\nregularize the neighborhood aggregation of the backbone, which facilitates the\nmessage passing of features for salient nodes and suppresses the less relevant\nnodes. Thus, our model can learn more effective graph representation. We\ndemonstrate the merits of SAR-GNN by extensive experiments on seven datasets\nacross various types of graph data. Code will be released.",

                "summary": "Patient representation learning based on electronic health records (EHR) is a\ncritical task for disease prediction. This task aims to effectively extract\nuseful information on dynamic features. Although various existing works have\nachieved remarkable progress, the model performance can be further improved by\nfully extracting the trends, variations, and the correlation between the trends\nand variations in dynamic features. In addition, sparse visit records limit the\nperformance of deep learning models. To address these issues, we propose the\nMulti-perspective Patient Representation Extractor (MPRE) for disease\nprediction. Specifically, we propose Frequency Transformation Module (FTM) to\nextract the trend and variation information of dynamic features in the\ntime-frequency domain, which can enhance the feature representation. In the 2D\nMulti-Extraction Network (2D MEN), we form the 2D temporal tensor based on\ntrend and variation. Then, the correlations between trend and variation are\ncaptured by the proposed dilated operation. Moreover, we propose the\nFirst-Order Difference Attention Mechanism (FODAM) to calculate the\ncontributions of differences in adjacent variations to the disease diagnosis\nadaptively. To evaluate the performance of MPRE and baseline methods, we\nconduct extensive experiments on two real-world public datasets. The experiment\nresults show that MPRE outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms\nof AUROC and AUPRC.",

Despite LLMs' prowess in tasks like writing assistance, code\ngeneration, and machine translation, assessing their ability to reason has been\nchallenging. Traditional evaluations often prioritize accuracy on downstream\ntasks over direct assessments of reasoning processes. LogicAsker addresses this\ngap by employing a set of atomic reasoning skills grounded in propositional and\npredicate logic to systematically examine and improve the reasoning prowess of\nLLMs. Our methodology reveals significant gaps in LLMs' learning of logical\nrules, with identified reasoning failures ranging from 29\\% to 90\\% across\ndifferent models. Moreover, we leverage these findings to construct targeted\ndemonstration examples and fine-tune data, notably enhancing logical reasoning\nin models like GPT-4o by up to 5\\%. To our knowledge, this is the first effort\nto utilize test case outcomes to effectively refine LLMs' formal reasoning\ncapabilities. We make our code, data, and results publicly available\n(https://github.com/yxwan123/LogicAsker) to facilitate further research and\nreplication of our findings.",

Here we study the spin dynamics of a ferromagnetic\nKondo-Heisenberg lattice model at finite temperature, and propose a mechanism\nof magnon damping that explains the intriguing experimental results. In\nparticular, we find the magnon damping rate $\\gamma(T)$ firstly decreases as\ntemperature lowers, due to the reduced magnon-magnon scatterings. It then\nreaches a minimum at $T_{\\rm d}^*$, and rises up again following a logarithmic\nscaling $\\gamma(T) \\sim \\ln{(T_0/T)}$ (with $T_0$ a constant) for $T < T_{\\rm\nd}^*$, which can be attributed to electron-magnon scatterings of spin-flip\ntype. Moreover, we obtain the phase diagram containing the ferromagnetic and\nKondo insulator phases by varying the Kondo coupling, which may be relevant for\nexperiments on pressured FGT. The presence of a magnon damping minimum and\nlogarithmic scaling at low temperature indicates the emergence of the Kondo\neffect reflected in the collective excitations of local moments in a Kondo\nlattice system.",

A family $\\mathscr{D}$ of $(n-d)$-dominoes is\na tiling of the box $[0,2]^n$ if interiors of every two members of\n$\\mathscr{D}$ are disjoint and $\\bigcup_{B\\in \\mathscr{D}}B=[0,2]^n$. An\n$(n-d)$-domino tiling $\\mathscr{D}'$ is obtained from an $(n-d)$-domino tiling\n$\\mathscr{D}$ by a flip, if there is a twin pair $A,B\\in \\mathscr{D}$ such that\n$\\mathscr{D}'=(\\mathscr{D}\\setminus \\{A,B\\})\\cup \\{C,D\\}$, where $C,D$ is a\nflip of $A,B$. A family of $(n-d)$-domino tilings of the box $[0,2]^n$ is\nflip-connected, if for every two members $\\mathscr{D},\\mathscr{E}$ of this\nfamily the tiling $\\mathscr{E}$ can be obtained from $\\mathscr{D}$ by a\nsequence of flips. In the paper some flip-connected class of $(n-d)$-domino\ntilings of the box $[0,2]^n$ is described.",

Howe curves are very useful to\nproduce important classes of curves over fields of positive characteristic,\ne.g., maximal, superspecial, or supersingular ones. Determining their feasible\nequations explicitly is a basic problem, and it has been solved in the\nhyperelliptic case and in the non-hyperelliptic case with genus not greater\nthan $4$. In this paper, we construct an explicit plane sextic model for\nnon-hyperelliptic Howe curves of genus $5$. We also determine the number and\ntype of singularities on our sextic model, and prove that the singularities are\ngenerically $4$ double points. Our results together with Moriya-Kudo's recent\nones imply that for each $s \\in \\{2,3,4,5\\}$, there exists a non-hyperellptic\ncurve $H$ of genus $5$ with $\\mathrm{Aut}(H) \\supset \\mathbf{V}_4$ such that\nits associated plane sextic has $s$ double points.",

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are foundational in various\napplications due to their extensive knowledge from pre-training and\nfine-tuning. Despite this, they are prone to generating factual and commonsense\nerrors, raising concerns in critical areas like healthcare, journalism, and\neducation to mislead users. Current methods for evaluating LLMs' veracity are\nlimited by test data leakage or the need for extensive human labor, hindering\nefficient and accurate error detection. To tackle this problem, we introduce a\nnovel, automatic testing framework, FactChecker, aimed at uncovering factual\ninaccuracies in LLMs. This framework involves three main steps: First, it\nconstructs a factual knowledge graph by retrieving fact triplets from a\nlarge-scale knowledge database. Then, leveraging the knowledge graph,\nFactChecker employs a rule-based approach to generates three types of questions\n(Yes-No, Multiple-Choice, and WH questions) that involve single-hop and\nmulti-hop relations, along with correct answers. Lastly, it assesses the LLMs'\nresponses for accuracy using tailored matching strategies for each question\ntype. Our extensive tests on six prominent LLMs, including text-davinci-002,\ntext-davinci-003, ChatGPT~(gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4), Vicuna, and LLaMA-2, reveal\nthat FactChecker can trigger factual errors in up to 45\\% of questions in these\nmodels. Moreover, we demonstrate that FactChecker's test cases can improve\nLLMs' factual accuracy through in-context learning and fine-tuning (e.g.,\nllama-2-13b-chat's accuracy increase from 35.3\\% to 68.5\\%). We are making all\ncode, data, and results available for future research endeavors.",

                "summary": "Image generation models can generate or edit images from a given text. Recent\nadvancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and\nMidjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their\nimpressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making\nthem susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and\nbiases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias\nwithin image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including\nlimited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive\nanalysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel evaluation framework\nthat can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in\nimage generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of\nindividuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using\ngender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39\nactivities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then\ncompares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on the\nsignificant changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a key\ninsight that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to\nneutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social\nbias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. We use BiasPainter\nto evaluate six widely-used image generation models, such as stable diffusion\nand Midjourney. Experimental results show that BiasPainter can successfully\ntrigger social bias in image generation models. According to our human\nevaluation, BiasPainter can achieve 90.8% accuracy on automatic bias detection,\nwhich is significantly higher than the results reported in previous work.",

                "summary": "Cryptography is the study of securing information. It is the physical process\nthat scrambles the information by rearrangement and substitution of content, so\nthat it becomes difficult for anyone to understand. In today's world, security\nhas become an inevitable part of our day-to-day life, right from normal\nbrowsing to performing critical payment transactions. Hackers work endlessly to\nbreak the security present in the apps/websites on which we perform day-to-day\noperations and salvage valuable information. Because of this, many illegal\nactivities have taken place which affect the user. One such illegal activity is\ntapping the voice communication between two users. If left unencrypted, the\ncommunication between the users is compromised, thereby causing issues. One way\nto prevent this act is to encrypt the audio in that the contents cannot have\ntampered with unless the receiver has the valid key to decrypt it. The proposed\nsolution termed \"HexE\" aims to create a puzzle-based algorithm which would\nencrypt and decrypt the audio files without manipulating the file header, thus\nsecuring the contents. The algorithm works on an NxN SuDoKu-based puzzle which\nis accepted both by the sender and receiver. Using the timestamp of the event\n(UNIX based), a grid from the puzzle is chosen which in turn will act as the\nkey for both encryption and decryption. If the timestamp is slightly adjusted,\nthe process will end up in failure during decryption, thus ensuring\nconfidentiality. Another approach to secure the audio files is to implement\nIPFS (Inter Planetary File System) alongside the puzzle algorithm in which the\nencrypted audio is stored on it and the receiver can fetch the audio provided\nif the valid IPFS Hash of the file is present. In this way, the audio file is\nsecured.",

                "summary": "It is highly desired but challenging to acquire high-quality photos with\nclear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing\nmethods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made\nsignificant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus on specific\nrestoration or enhancement problems, and do not fully explore the potential of\nutilizing multiple images. Motivated by the fact that multi-exposure images are\ncomplementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and\nsuper-resolution, we propose to utilize exposure bracketing photography to\nunify image restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the\ndifficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first\npre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to\nreal-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent\nnetwork (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover,\nwe construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect\nreal-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets\nshow that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art\nmulti-image processing ones.

                "summary": "With the onset of the era of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, the search\nfor continuous gravitational waves (CGWs), which remain undetected to date, has\nintensified in more ways than one. Rapidly rotating neutron stars with\nnon-axisymmetrical deformations are the main targets for CGW searches. The\nextent of this quadrupolar deformation is measured by the maximum ellipticity\nthat can be sustained by the crust of a neutron star and it places an upper\nlimit on the CGW amplitudes emitted by such systems. In this paper, following\nprevious works on this subject, we calculate the maximum ellipticity of a\nneutron star generated by the Lorentz force exerted on it by the internal\nmagnetic fields. We show that the ellipticity of stars deformed by such a\nLorentz force is of the same order of magnitude as previous theoretical and\nastrophysical constraints. We also consider if this ellipticity can be further\nenhanced by crustal surface currents. We discover that this is indeed true;\nsurface currents at crustal boundaries are instrumental towards enhancing the\nellipticity of magnetized neutron stars.",

                "summary": "In this paper, we present a theoretical, experimental, and numerical study of\nthe dynamics of cavitation bubbles inside a droplet suspended in another host\nfluid. On the theoretical side, we provided a modified Rayleigh collapse time\nand natural frequency for spherical bubbles in our particular context,\ncharacterized by the density ratio between the two liquids and the\nbubble-to-droplet size ratio. Regarding the experimental aspect, experiments\nwere carried out for laser-induced cavitation bubbles inside oil-in-water (O/W)\nor water-in-oil (W/O) droplets. Two distinct fluid-mixing mechanisms were\nunveiled in the two systems, respectively. In the case of O/W droplets, a\nliquid jet emerges around the end of the bubble collapse phase, effectively\npenetrating the droplet interface. We offer a detailed analysis of the criteria\ngoverning jet penetration, involving the standoff parameter and impact velocity\nof the bubble jet on the droplet surface. Conversely, in the scenario involving\nW/O droplets, the bubble traverses the droplet interior, inducing global motion\nand eventually leading to droplet pinch-off when the local Weber number exceeds\na critical value. This phenomenon is elucidated through the equilibrium between\ninterfacial and kinetic energies. Lastly, our boundary integral model\nfaithfully reproduces the essential physics of nonspherical bubble dynamics\nobserved in the experiments. We conduct a parametric study spanning a wide\nparameter space to investigate bubble-droplet interactions. The insights from\nthis study could serve as a valuable reference for practical applications in\nthe field of ultrasonic emulsification, pharmacy, etc.",

                "summary": "Vector-like quarks have been predicted in various new physics scenarios\nbeyond the Standard Model (SM). In a simplified modelling of a $(B,Y)$ doublet\nincluding a vector-like quark $Y$, with charge $-\\frac{4}{3}$e, there are only\ntwo free parameters: the $Y$ coupling $\\kappa_{Y}$ and mass $m_Y$. In the five\nflavor scheme, we investigate the single production of the $Y$ state decaying\ninto $Wb$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run-III and High-Luminosity LHC\n(HL-LHC) operating at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, the possible High-Energy LHC\n(HE-LHC) with $\\sqrt{s}$ = 27 TeV as well as the Future Circular Collider in\nhadron-hadron mode (FCC-hh) with $\\sqrt{s}$ = 100 TeV. Through detailed\nsignal-to-background analyses and detector simulations, we assess the exclusion\ncapabilities of the $Y$ state at the different colliders. We find that this can\nbe improved significantly with increasing collision energy, especially at the\nHE-LHC and FCC-hh, both demonstrating an obvious advantage with respect to the\nHL-LHC in the case of high $m_Y$. Assuming a 10\\% systematic uncertainty on the\nbackground event rate, the exclusion capabilities are summarized as follows:\n(1) the LHC Run-III can exclude the correlated regions of $\\kappa_{Y} \\in\n[0.06,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \\in [1500\\text{ GeV},3800\\text{ GeV}]$ with integrated\nluminosity $L = 300\\text{ fb}^{-1}$; (2) the HL-LHC can exclude the correlated\nregions of $\\kappa_{Y} \\in [0.05,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \\in [1500\\text{\nGeV},3970\\text{ GeV}]$ with $L = 3$ ab$^{-1}$; (3) the HE-LHC can exclude the\ncorrelated regions of $\\kappa_Y \\in [0.06,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \\in [1500\\text{ GeV}\n, 6090\\text{ GeV}]$ with $L = 3$ ab$^{-1}$; (4) the FCC-hh can exclude the\ncorrelated regions of $\\kappa_{Y} \\in [0.08,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \\in [1500\\text{\nGeV} , 10080\\text{ GeV}]$ with $L = 3$ ab$^{-1}$.",

                "summary": "We discuss the gravitational wave (GW) spectra predicted from the electroweak\nscalegenesis of the Higgs portal type with a large number of dark chiral\nflavors, which many flavor QCD would underlie and give the dynamical\nexplanation of the negative Higgs portal coupling required to trigger the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. We employ the linear-sigma model as the\nlow-energy description of dark many flavor QCD and show that the model\nundergoes ultra-supercooling due to the produced strong first-order thermal\nphase transition along the (approximately realized) flat direction based on the\nGildener-Weinberg mechanism. Passing through evaluation of the bubble\nnucleation/percolation, we address the reheating and relaxation processes,\nwhich are generically non-thermal and nonadiabatic. Parametrizing the reheating\nepoch in terms of the e-folding number, we propose proper formulae for the\nredshift effects on the GW frequencies and signal spectra. It then turns out\nthat the ultra-supercooling predicted from the Higgs-portal scalegenesis\ngenerically yields none of GW signals with the frequencies as low as nano Hz,\nunless the released latent heat is transported into another sector other than\nreheating the universe. Instead, models of this class prefer to give the higher\nfrequency signals and still keeps the future prospected detection sensitivity,\nlike at LISA, BBO, and DECIGO, etc. We also find that with large flavors in the\ndark sector, the GW signals are made further smaller and the peak frequencies\nhigher. Characteristic phenomenological consequences related to the multiple\nchiral scalars include the prediction of dark pions with the mass much less\nthan TeV scale, which is also briefly addressed.",

When extending RISC-V\nand other similar extensible processor architectures, the task of designing\nspecialized instructions arises. This task can be solved automatically by using\ninstruction synthesis algorithms. In this paper, we consider algorithms that\ncan be used in addition to the known approaches and improve the synthesized\ninstruction sets by recomputing common operations (the result of which is\nconsumed by multiple operations) of a program inside clustered synthesized\ninstructions (common operations clustering algorithm), and by identifying\nredundant (which have equivalents among the other instructions) synthesized\ninstructions (subsuming functions algorithm).\n  Experimental evaluations of the developed algorithms are presented for the\ntests from the domains of cryptography and three-dimensional graphics. For\nMagma cipher test, the common operations clustering algorithm allows reducing\nthe size of the compiled code by 9%, and the subsuming functions algorithm\nallows reducing the synthesized instruction set extension size by 2 times. For\nAES cipher test, the common operations clustering algorithm allows reducing the\nsize of the compiled code by 10%, and the subsuming functions algorithm allows\nreducing the synthesized instruction set extension size by 2.5 times. Finally,\nfor the instruction set extension from Volume Ray-Casting test, the additional\nuse of subsuming functions algorithm allows reducing problem-specific\ninstruction extension set size from 5 to only 2 instructions without losing its\nfunctionality.",

                "summary": "Probabilistic mixture models are recognized as effective tools for\nunsupervised outlier detection owing to their interpretability and global\ncharacteristics. Among these, Dirichlet process mixture models stand out as a\nstrong alternative to conventional finite mixture models for both clustering\nand outlier detection tasks. Unlike finite mixture models, Dirichlet process\nmixtures are infinite mixture models that automatically determine the number of\nmixture components based on the data. Despite their advantages, the adoption of\nDirichlet process mixture models for unsupervised outlier detection has been\nlimited by challenges related to computational inefficiency and sensitivity to\noutliers in the construction of outlier detectors. Additionally, Dirichlet\nprocess Gaussian mixtures struggle to effectively model non-Gaussian data with\ndiscrete or binary features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\noutlier detection method that utilizes ensembles of Dirichlet process Gaussian\nmixtures. This unsupervised algorithm employs random subspace and subsampling\nensembles to ensure efficient computation and improve the robustness of the\noutlier detector. The ensemble approach further improves the suitability of the\nproposed method for detecting outliers in non-Gaussian data. Furthermore, our\nmethod uses variational inference for Dirichlet process mixtures, which ensures\nboth efficient and rapid computation. Empirical analyses using benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in\nunsupervised outlier detection.",

Extension of Lawson's\niteration for the rational minimax approximation with both computationally high\nefficiency and theoretical guarantee is challenging. A recent work [L.-H.\nZhang, L. Yang, W. H. Yang and Y.-N. Zhang, A convex dual programming for the\nrational minimax approximation and Lawson's iteration, 2023,\narXiv:2308.06991v1] reveals that Lawson's iteration can be viewed as a method\nfor solving the dual problem of the original rational minimax approximation,\nand a new type of Lawson's iteration was proposed. Such a dual problem is\nguaranteed to obtain the original minimax solution under Ruttan's sufficient\ncondition, and numerically, the proposed Lawson's iteration was observed to\nconverge monotonically with respect to the dual objective function. In this\npaper, we perform theoretical convergence analysis for Lawson's iteration for\nboth the linear and rational minimax approximations. In particular, we show\nthat (i) for the linear minimax approximation, the near-optimal Lawson exponent\n$\\beta$ in Lawson's iteration is $\\beta=1$, and (ii) for the rational minimax\napproximation, the proposed Lawson's iteration converges monotonically with\nrespect to the dual objective function for any sufficiently small $\\beta>0$,\nand the limit approximant fulfills the complementary slackness: any node\nassociated with positive weight either is an interpolation point or has a\nconstant error.",

Existing benchmarking tasks often require models to\nidentify the temporal validity duration of a single statement. However, in many\ncases, additional contextual information, such as sentences in a story or posts\non a social media profile, can be collected from the available text stream.\nThis contextual information may greatly alter the duration for which a\nstatement is expected to be valid. We propose Temporal Validity Change\nPrediction, a natural language processing task benchmarking the capability of\nmachine learning models to detect contextual statements that induce such\nchange. We create a dataset consisting of temporal target statements sourced\nfrom Twitter and crowdsource sample context statements. We then benchmark a set\nof transformer-based language models on our dataset.

                "summary": "Highway traffic crashes exert a considerable impact on both transportation\nsystems and the economy. In this context, accurate and dependable emergency\nresponses are crucial for effective traffic management. However, the influence\nof crashes on traffic status varies across diverse factors and may be biased\ndue to selection bias. Therefore, there arises a necessity to accurately\nestimate the heterogeneous causal effects of crashes, thereby providing\nessential insights to facilitate individual-level emergency decision-making.\nThis paper proposes a novel causal machine learning framework to estimate the\ncausal effect of different types of crashes on highway speed. The Neyman-Rubin\nCausal Model (RCM) is employed to formulate this problem from a causal\nperspective. The Conditional Shapley Value Index (CSVI) is proposed based on\ncausal graph theory to filter adverse variables, and the Structural Causal\nModel (SCM) is then adopted to define the statistical estimand for causal\neffects. The treatment effects are estimated by Doubly Robust Learning (DRL)\nmethods, which combine doubly robust causal inference with classification and\nregression machine learning models. Experimental results from 4815 crashes on\nHighway Interstate 5 in Washington State reveal the heterogeneous treatment\neffects of crashes at varying distances and durations. The rear-end crashes\ncause more severe congestion and longer durations than other types of crashes,\nand the sideswipe crashes have the longest delayed impact. Additionally, the\nfindings show that rear-end crashes affect traffic greater at night, while\ncrash to objects has the most significant influence during peak hours.\nStatistical hypothesis tests, error metrics based on matched \"counterfactual\noutcomes\", and sensitive analyses are employed for assessment, and the results\nvalidate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method.",

The EU began expanding initially with\nno interaction among the cosmic fluids. Assuming an interaction that sets in at\na time $t \\geq t_i$ in the fluid components, we study the evolution of the EU\nthat leads to the present observed universe.

                "summary": "Superradiant Raman scattering of Rubidium atoms has been explored in the\nexperiment [Nature 484, 78 (2012)] to prove the concept of the superradiant\nlaser, which attracts significant attentions in quantum metrology due to the\nexpected ultra-narrow linewidth down to millihertz. To better understand the\nphysics involved in this experiment, we have developed a quantum master\nequation theory by treating the Rubidium atoms as three-level systems, and\ncoupling them with a dressed laser and an optical cavity. Our simulations show\ndifferent superradiant Raman scattering pulses for the systems within the\ncrossover and strong coupling regime, and the shifted and broader spectrum of\nthe steady-state Raman scattering. Thus, our studies provide a unified view on\nthe superradiant Raman scattering pulses, and an alternative explanation to the\nbroad spectrum of the steady-state Raman scattering, as observed in the\nexperiment. In future, our theory can be readily applied to study other\ninteresting phenomena relying on the superradiant Raman scattering, such as\nmagnetic field sensing, real-time tracking of quantum phase, Dicke phase\ntransition of non-equilibrium dynamics and so on.",

                "summary": "After introducing a bit-plane quantum representation for a multi-image, we\npresent a novel way to encrypt/decrypt multiple images using a quantum\ncomputer. Our encryption scheme is based on a two-stage scrambling of the\nimages and of the bit planes on one hand and of the pixel positions on the\nother hand, each time using quantum baker maps. The resulting quantum\nmulti-image is then diffused with controlled CNOT gates using a sine\nchaotification of a two-dimensional H\\'enon map as well as Chebyshev\npolynomials. The decryption is processed by operating all the inverse quantum\ngates in the reverse order.",

We introduce Astraios, a suite of 28\ninstruction-tuned OctoCoder models using 7 tuning methods and 4 model sizes up\nto 16 billion parameters. Through investigations across 5 tasks and 8 different\ndatasets encompassing both code comprehension and code generation tasks, we\nfind that FFT generally leads to the best downstream performance across all\nscales, and PEFT methods differ significantly in their efficacy based on the\nmodel scale. LoRA usually offers the most favorable trade-off between cost and\nperformance. Further investigation into the effects of these methods on both\nmodel robustness and code security reveals that larger models tend to\ndemonstrate reduced robustness and less security. At last, we explore the\nrelationships among updated parameters, cross-entropy loss, and task\nperformance. We find that the tuning effectiveness observed in small models\ngeneralizes well to larger models, and the validation loss in instruction\ntuning can be a reliable indicator of overall downstream performance.",

Most prior approaches explore representation learning\non egocentric videos only, while overlooking the potential benefit of\nexploiting existing large-scale third-person videos. In this paper, (1) we\ndevelop EgoInstructor, a retrieval-augmented multimodal captioning model that\nautomatically retrieves semantically relevant third-person instructional videos\nto enhance the video captioning of egocentric videos. (2) For training the\ncross-view retrieval module, we devise an automatic pipeline to discover\nego-exo video pairs from distinct large-scale egocentric and exocentric\ndatasets. (3) We train the cross-view retrieval module with a novel EgoExoNCE\nloss that pulls egocentric and exocentric video features closer by aligning\nthem to shared text features that describe similar actions. (4) Through\nextensive experiments, our cross-view retrieval module demonstrates superior\nperformance across seven benchmarks. Regarding egocentric video captioning,\nEgoInstructor exhibits significant improvements by leveraging third-person\nvideos as references.

We\nobserve that, more generally, under some conditions on a compact space endowed\nwith a finite Borel measure an analogous Polish group topology can be defined\non the subgroup of the homeomorphism group which push forward the measure to\nanother one with which it is mutually absolutely continuous. We use a\nprobabilistic argument involving approximations by supmartingale processes to\nshow that in many cases there is no group topology between $\\tau_{ac}$ and the\nrestriction $\\tau_{co}$ of the compact-open topology. This applies, in\nparticular, to any compact topological manifold equipped with an Oxtoby-Ulam\nmeasure and to the Cantor space endowed with some natural Borel measures. In\nfact, we show that in such cases any separable group topology strictly finer\nthan $\\tau_{co}$ has to be also finer than $\\tau_{ac}$. For one-dimensional\nmanifolds well-known arguments show that the compact-open topology is a minimum\nHausdroff group topology on the group, which implies that $\\tau_{co}$ and\n$\\tau_{ac}$ are the only Hausdorff group topologies coarser than $\\tau_{ac}$.\nWe also show that while Solecki's example is not Roelcke precompact, the group\nof bi-absolutely continuous homeomorphisms of the Cantor space endowed with the\nmeasure given by the Fr\\\"aiss\\'e limit of the class of measured boolean\nalgebras with rational probability measures is Roelcke precompact.",

Specifically, we show that scalar multiplets\ncoupled to the gauge sector of a grand unified theory provide a mechanism for a\ntime-varying unified coupling which has low-energy consequences which can be\nprobed with quantum sensors. We then assume that the multiplets represent ultra\nlight dark matter.

                "summary": "With the growing use of large language models hosted on cloud platforms to\noffer inference services, privacy concerns are escalating, especially\nconcerning sensitive data like investment plans and bank account details.\nSecure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC) emerges as a promising solution to protect\nthe privacy of inference data and model parameters. However, the application of\nSMPC in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for large language models,\nparticularly those based on the Transformer architecture, often leads to\nconsiderable slowdowns or declines in performance. This is largely due to the\nmultitude of nonlinear operations in the Transformer architecture, which are\nnot well-suited to SMPC and difficult to circumvent or optimize effectively. To\naddress this concern, we introduce an advanced optimization framework called\nSecFormer, to achieve fast and accurate PPI for Transformer models. By\nimplementing model design optimization, we successfully eliminate the high-cost\nexponential and maximum operations in PPI without sacrificing model\nperformance. Additionally, we have developed a suite of efficient SMPC\nprotocols that utilize segmented polynomials, Fourier series and Goldschmidt's\nmethod to handle other complex nonlinear functions within PPI, such as GeLU,\nLayerNorm, and Softmax. Our extensive experiments reveal that SecFormer\noutperforms MPCFormer in performance, showing improvements of $5.6\\%$ and\n$24.2\\%$ for BERT$_{\\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\\text{LARGE}}$, respectively. In\nterms of efficiency, SecFormer is 3.56 and 3.58 times faster than Puma for\nBERT$_{\\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\\text{LARGE}}$, demonstrating its effectiveness\nand speed.",

                "summary": "Pre-trained recommendation models (PRMs) have received increasing interest\nrecently. However, their intrinsically heterogeneous model structure, huge\nmodel size and computation cost hinder their adoptions in practical recommender\nsystems. Hence, it is highly essential to explore how to use different\npre-trained recommendation models efficiently in real-world systems. In this\npaper, we propose a novel curriculum-scheduled knowledge distillation from\nmultiple pre-trained teachers for multi-domain sequential recommendation,\ncalled CKD-MDSR, which takes full advantages of different PRMs as multiple\nteacher models to boost a small student recommendation model, integrating the\nknowledge across multiple domains from PRMs. Specifically, CKD-MDSR first\nadopts curriculum-scheduled user behavior sequence sampling and distills\ninformative knowledge jointly from the representative PRMs such as UniSRec and\nRecformer. Then, the knowledge from the above PRMs are selectively integrated\ninto the student model in consideration of their confidence and consistency.\nFinally, we verify the proposed method on multi-domain sequential\nrecommendation and further demonstrate its universality with multiple types of\nstudent models, including feature interaction and graph based recommendation\nmodels. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of CKD-MDSR, which can be viewed as an efficient\nshortcut using PRMs in real-world systems.",

However, the\neye-brain system functions differently from electronic sensors and its products\ncan be expected to have different characteristics. Here I characterize some\naspects of the visual data set by examining ten well-observed variable stars\nfrom the AAVSO database. The standard deviation around a best-fit curve ranges\nfrom 0.14 to 0.34 magnitude, smaller than most previous estimates. The\ndifference in scatter between stars is significant, but does not correlate with\nsuch things as range or quickness of variation, or even with color. Naked-eye\nvariables, which would be expected to be more difficult to observe accurately,\nin fact show the smallest scatter. The difference between observers (bias) is\nless important than each observer's internal precision. A given observer's\nprecision is not set but varies from star to star for unknown reasons.

                "summary": "Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of He-core remnants of the\nprimary components of intermediate-mass close binaries that lost most of their\nH/He envelopes due to the mass exchange. They are expected to be observed as\n(1-7) solar mass hot He-rich stars located in the HRD between sdO/B and\nWR-stars. Several thousands of such stars are expected to exist in the Galaxy,\nbut none of them have been identified so far. We aim to provide comprehensive\npredictions of the numbers and fundamental properties of He-stars and their\ncompanions in the Galaxy. This is a necessary first step to guide observations,\nto enable a comparison between evolutionary models and observed populations,\nand to determine the feedback of He-stars in the Galaxy. We expanded the\npreviously considered space of parameters describing progenitors of He-stars\nand applied a population synthesis based on a grid of models computed by the\ncode MESA. The estimated number of Galactic binaries hosting (1-7) solar mass\nHe-stars is about 20000; it declines to about 3000 for mass exceeding two solar\nones. The decisive factor that defines the number of He-stars is runaway mass\nloss after Roche lobe overflow by primary components, resulting in formation of\ncommon envelopes and merger of components. He-stars are much less numerous than\nexpected, since a fraction of close binaries with primary masses below (5-7)\nsolar ones produce subdwarfs with masses below solar. Overwhelming majority of\nHe-stars reside in binaries with an early-type companions and can be identified\nneither by the UV excess nor by emission features. The large periods of a\nsignificant fraction of binaries hosting stripped stars (exceeding several\nhundred days) also hamper their discovery. (Abridged).",

                "summary": "Besides ongoing studies of phase structural transitions, pairing mechanism,\nand physical properties of recently discovered highly compressed\nhigh-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\\delta}$, here we explored a\npossibility for the electron-phonon pairing mechanism as an origin of the\nsuperconducting state and determined the microcrystalline strain,\n$\\epsilon(P)$, in high pressure $Fmmm$-phase, and low-pressure $Ammm$-phase of\nthis nickelate. To do this, we analyzed temperature dependent resistance and\nextracted pressure dependent Debye temperature, $\\Theta_D(P)$, in\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\\delta}$ with an approximate value of $\\Theta_D(P = 25 GPa) =\n550$ $K$. From this we established that the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\\delta}$ is\nstrong-coupled superconductor with the electron-phonon coupling constant\n$\\lambda_{e-ph}(P=22.4 GPa) = 1.75$. This value is close to $\\lambda_{e-ph} =\n1.70$ of ambient pressure superconductors $Nb_3R (R = Sn, Al)$. To address\nongoing discussion that the lattice strain can be the origin for the emergence\nof high-temperature superconductivity in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\\delta}$, we\ndetermined the microcrystalline strain, $0.011 < \\epsilon(P)$, in the\nhigh-pressure $Fmmm$-phase, and $\\epsilon(P) < 0.011$ of low-pressure\n$Fmmm$-phase. Our analysis showed that $\\epsilon(P)$ has three-dome shape in\nthe pressure range of $1.6 GPa < P < 41.2 GPa$. One of these two $\\epsilon(P)$\ndeeps at $P \\approx 15 GPa$ coincides with the pressure at which the\n$Ammm$-phase into the $Fmmm$-phase phase transition occurs. Based on our\nanalysis, we proposed probable condition to observe the zero-resistance state\nin La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\\delta}$.",

Our results align with\nearlier studies extracting the coupling coefficients from select binary black\nhole merger simulations, showing consistency for the same remnant spins.\nNotably, the coupling coefficient is insensitive to a diverse range of initial\ndata, including configurations that led to a significant (up to $5\\%$) increase\nin the remnant black hole mass. These findings present opportunities for\ntesting the nonlinear dynamics of general relativity with ground-based\ngravitational wave observatories.

                "summary": "Urban air mobility (UAM), a transformative concept for the transport of\npassengers and cargo, faces several integration challenges in complex urban\nenvironments. Community acceptance of aircraft noise is among the most\nnoticeable of these challenges when launching or scaling up a UAM system.\nProperly managing community noise is fundamental to establishing a UAM system\nthat is environmentally and socially sustainable. In this work, we develop a\nholistic and equitable approach to manage UAM air traffic and its community\nnoise impact in urban environments. The proposed approach is a hybrid approach\nthat considers a mix of different noise mitigation strategies, including\nlimiting the number of operations, cruising at higher altitudes, and ambient\nnoise masking. We tackle the problem through the lens of network system control\nand formulate a multi-objective optimization model for managing traffic flow in\na multi-layer UAM network while concurrently pursuing demand fulfillment, noise\ncontrol, and energy saving. Further, we use a social welfare function in the\noptimization model as the basis for the efficiency-fairness trade-off in both\ndemand fulfillment and noise control. We apply the proposed approach to a\ncomprehensive case study in the city of Austin and perform design trade-offs\nthrough both visual and quantitative analyses.",

                "summary": "We have used data from the Outer Galaxy High-Resolution Survey (OGHReS) to\nrefine the velocities, distances, and physical properties of a large sample of\n3584 clumps detected in far infrared/submillimetre emission in the HiGAL survey\nlocated in the $\\ell = 250^\\circ-280^\\circ$ region of the Galactic plane. Using\n$^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO spectra, we have determined reliable velocities to 3412\nclumps (95% of the sample). In comparison to the velocities from the HiGAL\ncatalogue, we find good agreement for 80% of the sample (within 5 km/s). Using\nthe higher resolution and sensitivity of OGHReS has allowed us to correct the\nvelocity for 632 clumps and provide velocities for 687 clumps for which no\nvelocity had been previously allocated. The velocities are used with a rotation\ncurve to refine the distances to the clumps and to calculate the clumps'\nproperties using a distance-dependent gas-to-dust ratio. We have determined\nreliable physical parameters for 3200 outer Galaxy dense clumps (~90% of the\nHiGAL sources in the region). We find a trend of decreasing luminosity-to-mass\nratio with increasing Galactocentric distance, suggesting the star formation\nefficiency is lower in the outer Galaxy or that it is resulting in more lower\nmass stars than in the inner Galaxy. We also find a similar surface density for\nprotostellar clumps located in the inner and outer Galaxy, revealing that the\nsurface density requirements for star formation are the same across the\nGalactic disc.",

The\n$q$-deformation is defined by replacing the entries of representation matrices\nof the coboundary maps with their $q$-analogues. While the resulting maps do\nnot generally define cochain complexes, for certain special basis derived from\nreal structures, the $q$-deformation becomes again a cochain complex. Moreover,\nit exhibits universality in the sense that any specialization of $q$ to a\ncomplex number yields the cochain complex computing the corresponding local\nsystem cohomology group.",

Shopping is one of the most\npopular areas on these systems. The bot replaces the human salesperson and\ninteracts with the customers by speaking. To train the models behind the scenes\nof these systems, annotated data is needed. In this paper, we developed a\ndataset of dialogues in the Persian language through crowd-sourcing. We\nannotated these dialogues to train a model. This dataset contains nearly 22k\nutterances in 15 different domains and 1061 dialogues. This is the largest\nPersian dataset in this field, which is provided freely so that future\nresearchers can use it. Also, we proposed some baseline models for natural\nlanguage understanding (NLU) tasks. These models perform two tasks for NLU:\nintent classification and entity extraction.

                "summary": "The prominent large language models (LLMs) of today differ from past language\nmodels not only in size, but also in the fact that they are trained on a\ncombination of natural language and formal language (code). As a medium between\nhumans and computers, code translates high-level goals into executable steps,\nfeaturing standard syntax, logical consistency, abstraction, and modularity. In\nthis survey, we present an overview of the various benefits of integrating code\ninto LLMs' training data. Specifically, beyond enhancing LLMs in code\ngeneration, we observe that these unique properties of code help (i) unlock the\nreasoning ability of LLMs, enabling their applications to a range of more\ncomplex natural language tasks; (ii) steer LLMs to produce structured and\nprecise intermediate steps, which can then be connected to external execution\nends through function calls; and (iii) take advantage of code compilation and\nexecution environment, which also provides diverse feedback for model\nimprovement. In addition, we trace how these profound capabilities of LLMs,\nbrought by code, have led to their emergence as intelligent agents (IAs) in\nsituations where the ability to understand instructions, decompose goals, plan\nand execute actions, and refine from feedback are crucial to their success on\ndownstream tasks. Finally, we present several key challenges and future\ndirections of empowering LLMs with code.",

                "summary": "By 2050, it is predicted that there will be 9 billion people on the planet,\nwhich will call for more production, lower costs, and the preservation of\nnatural resources. It is anticipated that atypical occurrences and climate\nchange will pose severe risks to agricultural output. It follows that a 70% or\nmore significant rise in food output is anticipated. Smart farming, often known\nas agriculture 4.0, is a tech-driven revolution in agriculture with the goal of\nraising industry production and efficiency. Four primary trends are responsible\nfor it: food waste, climate change, population shifts, and resource scarcity.\nThe agriculture industry is changing as a result of the adoption of emerging\ntechnologies. Using cutting-edge technology like IoT, AI, and other sensors,\nsmart farming transforms traditional production methods and international\nagricultural policies. The objective is to establish a value chain that is\noptimized to facilitate enhanced monitoring and decreased labor expenses. The\nagricultural sector has seen tremendous transformation as a result of the\nfourth industrial revolution, which has combined traditional farming methods\nwith cutting-edge technology to increase productivity, sustainability, and\nefficiency. To effectively utilize the potential of technology gadgets in the\nagriculture sector, collaboration between governments, private sector entities,\nand other stakeholders is necessary. This paper covers Agriculture 4.0, looks\nat its possible benefits and drawbacks of the implementation methodologies,\ncompatibility, reliability, and investigates the several digital tools that are\nbeing utilized to change the agriculture industry and how to mitigate the\nchallenges.",

A common approach is to feed the result of a simple inversion, for\nexample the backprojection, to a convolutional neural network (CNN) which then\ncomputes the reconstruction. Despite strong results on 'in-distribution' test\ndata similar to the training data, backprojection from sparse-view data\ndelocalizes singularities, so these approaches require a large receptive field\nto perform well. As a consequence, they overfit to certain global structures\nwhich leads to poor generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.\nMoreover, their memory complexity and training time scale unfavorably with\nimage resolution, making them impractical for application at realistic clinical\nresolutions, especially in 3D: a standard U-Net requires a substantial 140GB of\nmemory and 2600 seconds per epoch on a research-grade GPU when training on\n1024x1024 images. In this paper, we introduce GLIMPSE, a local processing\nneural network for computed tomography which reconstructs a pixel value by\nfeeding only the measurements associated with the neighborhood of the pixel to\na simple MLP. While achieving comparable or better performance with successful\nCNNs like the U-Net on in-distribution test data, GLIMPSE significantly\noutperforms them on OOD samples while maintaining a memory footprint almost\nindependent of image resolution; 5GB memory suffices to train on 1024x1024\nimages. Further, we built GLIMPSE to be fully differentiable, which enables\nfeats such as recovery of accurate projection angles if they are out of\ncalibration.",

However, it also presents high path loss,\nresulting in limited coverage. High-gain beamforming from the antenna array is\nessential to mitigate the coverage limitations. The conventional phased antenna\narrays (PAA) cause high scheduling latency owing to analog beam constraints,\ni.e., only one frequency-flat beam is generated. Recently introduced joint\nphase-time array (JPTA) architecture, which utilizes both true-time-delay (TTD)\nunits and phase shifters (PSs), alleviates analog beam constraints by creating\nmultiple frequency-dependent beams for scheduling multiple users at different\ndirections in a frequency-division manner. One class of previous studies\noffered solutions with ``rainbow\" beams, which tend to allocate a small\nbandwidth per beam direction. Another class focused on uniform linear array\n(ULA) antenna architecture, whose frequency-dependent beams were designed along\na single axis of either azimuth or elevation direction. This paper presents a\nnovel 3D beamforming design that maximizes beamforming gain toward desired\nazimuth and elevation directions and across sub-bands partitioned according to\nscheduled users' bandwidth requirements. We provide analytical solutions and\niterative algorithms to design the PSs and TTD units for a desired subband beam\npattern. Through simulations of the beamforming gain, we observe that our\nproposed solutions outperform the state-of-the-art solutions reported\nelsewhere.",

                "summary": "The emergence of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) has greatly\nincreased interest in utilizing LLMs as therapists to support individuals\nstruggling with mental health challenges. However, due to the lack of\nsystematic studies, our understanding of how LLM therapists behave, i.e., ways\nin which they respond to clients, is significantly limited. Understanding their\nbehavior across a wide range of clients and situations is crucial to accurately\nassess their capabilities and limitations in the high-risk setting of mental\nhealth, where undesirable behaviors can lead to severe consequences. In this\npaper, we propose BOLT, a novel computational framework to study the\nconversational behavior of LLMs when employed as therapists. We develop an\nin-context learning method to quantitatively measure the behavior of LLMs based\non 13 different psychotherapy techniques including reflections, questions,\nsolutions, normalizing, and psychoeducation. Subsequently, we compare the\nbehavior of LLM therapists against that of high- and low-quality human therapy,\nand study how their behavior can be modulated to better reflect behaviors\nobserved in high-quality therapy. Our analysis of GPT and Llama-variants\nreveals that these LLMs often resemble behaviors more commonly exhibited in\nlow-quality therapy rather than high-quality therapy, such as offering a higher\ndegree of problem-solving advice when clients share emotions, which is against\ntypical recommendations. At the same time, unlike low-quality therapy, LLMs\nreflect significantly more upon clients' needs and strengths. Our analysis\nframework suggests that despite the ability of LLMs to generate anecdotal\nexamples that appear similar to human therapists, LLM therapists are currently\nnot fully consistent with high-quality care, and thus require additional\nresearch to ensure quality care.",

                "summary": "We consider a toy model for the study of monitored dynamics in a many-body\nquantum systems. We study the stochastic Schrodinger equation resulting from\nthe continuous monitoring with a rate $\\Gamma$ of a random hermitian operator\nchosen at every time from the gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). Due to\ninvariance by unitary transformations, the dynamics of the eigenvalues\n$\\{\\lambda_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha=1}^n$ of the density matrix can be decoupled from\nthat of the eigenvectors. Thus, stochastic equations are derived that exactly\ndescribe the dynamics of $\\lambda$'s. We consider two regimes: in the presence\nof an extra dephasing term, which can be generated by imperfect quantum\nmeasurements, the density matrix has a stationary distribution, and we show\nthat in the limit of large sizes the distribution of $\\lambda$'s is described\nby an inverse Marchenko Pastur distribution. In the case of perfect\nmeasurements instead, purification eventually occurs and we focus on\nfinite-time dynamics. In this case, remarkably, we find an exact solution for\nthe joint probability distribution of $\\lambda$'s at each time $t$ and for each\nsize $n$. Two relevant regimes emerge: at small times $t\\Gamma= O(1)$, the\nspectrum is in a Coulomb gas regime, with a well-defined continuous spectral\ndistribution in the limit of $n\\to\\infty$. In that case, all moments of the\ndensity matrix become self-averaging and it is possible to characterize the\nentanglement spectrum exactly. In the limit of large times $t \\Gamma = O(n)$\none enters instead a regime in which the eigenvalues are exponentially\nseparated $\\log(\\lambda_\\alpha/\\lambda_\\beta) = O(\\Gamma t/n)$, but\nfluctuations $\\sim O(\\sqrt{\\Gamma t/n})$ play an essential role. We are still\nable to characterize the asymptotic behaviors of entanglement entropy in this\nregime.",

                "summary": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable performance in neural\nrendering-based novel view synthesis. However, NeRF suffers from severe visual\nquality degradation when the input images have been captured under imperfect\nconditions, such as poor illumination, defocus blurring, and lens aberrations.\nEspecially, defocus blur is quite common in the images when they are normally\ncaptured using cameras. Although few recent studies have proposed to render\nsharp images of considerably high-quality, yet they still face many key\nchallenges. In particular, those methods have employed a Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP) based NeRF, which requires tremendous computational time. To overcome\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel technique Sharp-NeRF -- a\ngrid-based NeRF that renders clean and sharp images from the input blurry\nimages within half an hour of training. To do so, we used several grid-based\nkernels to accurately model the sharpness/blurriness of the scene. The\nsharpness level of the pixels is computed to learn the spatially varying blur\nkernels. We have conducted experiments on the benchmarks consisting of blurry\nimages and have evaluated full-reference and non-reference metrics. The\nqualitative and quantitative results have revealed that our approach renders\nthe sharp novel views with vivid colors and fine details, and it has\nconsiderably faster training time than the previous works.

In recent works we demonstrated how such a\nproblem could be cast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)\nproblem that can be embedded onto the D-Wave AdvantageTM quantum annealer\nsystem, demonstrating proof of principle. Our initial studies left open the\npossibility for improvement of D-Wave solutions via judicious choices of system\nrun parameters. Here we report on our investigations for optimizing these\nsystem parameters, and how we incorporate machine learning (ML) techniques to\nfurther improve on the quality of solutions. In particular, we use the Hamming\ndistance to investigate correlations between various system-run parameters and\nsolution vectors. We then apply a decision tree neural network (NN) to learn\nthese correlations, with the goal of using the neural network to provide\nfurther guesses to solution vectors. We successfully implement this NN in a\nsimple integer linear programming (ILP) example, demonstrating how the NN can\nfully map out the solution space that was not captured by D-Wave. We find,\nhowever, for the 3-node network problem the NN is not able to enhance the\nquality of space of solutions.",

Since such\ndensities arise as approximationw of an underlying functional density, we frame\nthe task as an instance of operator learning. We propose to approximate a\ntime-dependent neural operator whose time integral provides a mapping between\nthe functional distributions of the free and target theories. Once a particular\nlattice is chosen, the neural operator can be discretized to a\nfinite-dimensional, time-dependent vector field which in turn induces a\ncontinuous normalizing flow between finite dimensional distributions over the\nchosen lattice. This flow can then be trained to be a diffeormorphism between\nthe discretized free and target theories on the chosen lattice, and, by\nconstruction, can be evaluated on different discretizations of spacetime. We\nexperimentally validate the proposal on the 2-dimensional $\\phi^4$-theory to\nexplore to what extent such operator-based flow architectures generalize to\nlattice sizes they were not trained on, and show that pretraining on smaller\nlattices can lead to a speedup over training directly on the target lattice\nsize.",

                "summary": "Control design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has mostly focused on achieving a\nprespecified goal for an individually controlled AV or for a swarm of\ncooperatively controlled AVs. However, the impact of autonomous driving on\nhuman-driven vehicles (HVs) has been largely ignored in AV controller\nsynthesis, which could result in egoistic AV behavior detrimental to the safety\nof passengers and surrounding traffic. In this study we develop a general\nframework for socially compliant control design of AVs with a useful metric of\nsocial psychology, called social value orientation (SVO), allowing AVs to\nleverage their impact on the behavior of the following HVs. This is critical\nsince AVs that behave in a socially compliant manner enable human drivers to\ncomprehend their actions and respond appropriately. Within the proposed\nframework, we define the utilities of the controlled AV and its following\nvehicle, to be maximized in a weighted fashion determined by the AV's SVO. The\nutility maximization covers an array of design objectives given the goal of the\nAV and the benefits for the following HV stemming from the courtesy of socially\ncompliant AV controls. An optimal control problem is then formulated to\nmaximize the utility function defined, which is numerically solved using\nPontryagin's minimum principle with optimality guarantees. The methodology\ndeveloped is applied to synthesize socially compliant control for eco-driving\nof AVs. A set of numerical results are presented to show the mechanism and\neffectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world experimental data\ncollected on Highway 55 in Minnesota.",

                "summary": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language\nModel (LLM)-based systems, in education has shown promise in enhancing teaching\nand learning experiences. However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) like GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), capable of processing\nmultimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of\nenriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education.\nGrounded in theory of multimedia learning, this paper explores the\ntransformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by\npresenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios. Possible applications for\nMLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning,\nfostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and\nfeedback. These scenarios are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats\nbut can be multimodal, increasing thus personalization, accessibility, and\npotential learning effectiveness. Besides many opportunities, challenges such\nas data protection and ethical considerations become more salient, calling for\nrobust frameworks to ensure responsible integration. This paper underscores the\nnecessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology\ncomplements rather than supplants the educator's role, ensuring thus an\neffective and ethical use of AI in science education. It calls for further\nresearch to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs on the evolving role of\neducators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other\ndisciplines. Through the exploration of potentials, challenges, and future\nimplications, we aim to contribute to a preliminary understanding of the\ntransformative trajectory of MLLMs in science education and beyond.",

                "summary": "Despite significant progress in deep learning-based optical flow methods,\naccurately estimating large displacements and repetitive patterns remains a\nchallenge. The limitations of local features and similarity search patterns\nused in these algorithms contribute to this issue. Additionally, some existing\nmethods suffer from slow runtime and excessive graphic memory consumption. To\naddress these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach based on the RAFT\nframework. The proposed Attention-based Feature Localization (AFL) approach\nincorporates the attention mechanism to handle global feature extraction and\naddress repetitive patterns. It introduces an operator for matching pixels with\ncorresponding counterparts in the second frame and assigning accurate flow\nvalues. Furthermore, an Amorphous Lookup Operator (ALO) is proposed to enhance\nconvergence speed and improve RAFTs ability to handle large displacements by\nreducing data redundancy in its search operator and expanding the search space\nfor similarity extraction. The proposed method, Efficient RAFT\n(Ef-RAFT),achieves significant improvements of 10% on the Sintel dataset and 5%\non the KITTI dataset over RAFT. Remarkably, these enhancements are attained\nwith a modest 33% reduction in speed and a mere 13% increase in memory usage.\nThe code is available at: https://github.com/n3slami/Ef-RAFT",

                "summary": "Recent studies in Radiance Fields have paved the robust way for novel view\nsynthesis with their photorealistic rendering quality. Nevertheless, they\nusually employ neural networks and volumetric rendering, which are costly to\ntrain and impede their broad use in various real-time applications due to the\nlengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been\nproposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while\nrendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation\nin the rendering quality if the training images are blurry. Blurriness commonly\noccurs due to the lens defocusing, object motion, and camera shake, and it\ninevitably intervenes in clean image acquisition. Several previous studies have\nattempted to render clean and sharp images from blurry input images using\nneural fields. The majority of those works, however, are designed only for\nvolumetric rendering-based neural radiance fields and are not straightforwardly\napplicable to rasterization-based 3D Gaussian splatting methods. Thus, we\npropose a novel real-time deblurring framework, Deblurring 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, using a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that manipulates the\ncovariance of each 3D Gaussian to model the scene blurriness. While Deblurring\n3D Gaussian Splatting can still enjoy real-time rendering, it can reconstruct\nfine and sharp details from blurry images. A variety of experiments have been\nconducted on the benchmark, and the results have revealed the effectiveness of\nour approach for deblurring.

We review recent progress on a dynamical systems theory of the\nheterochaos baker maps, and present new results on properties of measures of\nmaximal entropy and the underlying Lebesgue measure.

Flat and rank one\nsymmetric spaces are examples of harmonic manifolds. Damek-Ricci spaces are\nnon-compact harmonic manifolds, most of which are non-symmetric. Taking the\nlimit of an \"inflating\" sphere through a point $p$ in a Damek-Ricci space as\nthe center of the sphere runs out to infinity along a geodesic half-line\n$\\gamma$ starting from $p$, we get a horosphere. Similarly to spheres,\nhorospheres are also isoparametric hypersurfaces. In this paper, we define the\nsphere-like hypersurfaces obtained by \"overinflating the horospheres\" by\npushing the center of the sphere beyond the point at infinity of $\\gamma$ along\na virtual prolongation of $\\gamma$. They give a new family of isoparametric\nhypersurfaces in Damek-Ricci spaces connecting geodesic spheres to some of the\nisoparametric hypersurfaces constructed by J. C.

We introduce a\nnovel Demmler-Reinsch basis expansion to model the functional effects that\nallows us to orthogonally decompose an effect into its linear and nonlinear\nparts. We show that our representation allows to consistently estimate both\nparts as opposed to commonly employed mixed model representations. Equipping\nthe reparameterized regression coefficients with normal beta prime spike and\nslab priors allows us to determine whether a continuous covariate has a linear,\na nonlinear or no effect at all.

We prove that the same holds over every 1- or 2-generated field;\nin particular, over every field that is a finite degree extension of its prime\nfield. Furthermore, let $F$, $t$, $V$, $d\\geq 3$, $[d/2]$, and $m$ denote an\narbitrary field, the minimum cardinality of a generating set of $F$, a finite\ndimensional vector space over $F$, the dimension (assumed to be at least $3$)\nof $V$, the integer part of $d/2$, and the least cardinal such that $m[d^2/4]$\nis at least $t$, respectively. We prove that Sub$(V)$ is $(4+m)$-generated but\nnone of its generating sets is of size less than $m$. Moreover, the $k$-th\ndirect power of Sub$(V)$ is $(5+m)$-generated for many positive integers $k$;\nfor all positive integers $k$ if $F$ is infinite. Finally, let $n$ be a\npositive integer. For $i=1,\\dots, n$, let $p_i$ be a prime number or 0, and let\n$V_i$ be the 3-dimensional vector space over the prime field of characteristic\n$p_i$. We prove that the direct product of the lattices Sub$(V_1)$, ...,\nSub$(V_n)$ is 4-generated if and only if each of the numbers $p_1$, ..., $p_n$\noccurs at most four times in the sequence $p_1$, ..., $p_n$.

                "summary": "In distributed radar systems, when several transmitters radiate\nsimultaneously, the reflected signals need to be distinguished at the receivers\nto detect various targets. If the transmit signals are in different frequency\nbands, they require a large overall bandwidth. Instead, a set of\npseudo-orthogonal waveforms derived from the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences could be\naccommodated in the same band, enabling the efficient use of available\nbandwidth for better range resolution. In such a design, special care must be\ngiven to the 'near-far' problem, where a reflection could possibly become\ndifficult to detect due to the presence of stronger reflections. In this work,\na scheme to detect multiple targets in such distributed radar systems is\nproposed. It performs successive cancellations (SC) starting from the strong,\ndetectable reflections in the domain of the Discrete Chirp-Fourier Transform\n(DCFT) after compensating for Doppler shifts, enabling the subsequent\ndetections of weaker targets which are not trivially detectable. Numerical\nsimulations corroborate the efficacy and usefulness of the proposed method in\ndetecting weak target reflections.",

We implement the\nalgorithm on a supercomputer using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The Stokes\nexpansion introduces hyperbolic trigonometric terms that require exponentiation\nof power series. We handle this efficiently using Bell polynomials. Under mild\nassumptions on the fluid depth, we prove that there are no exact resonances,\nthough small divisors may occur. Sudden changes in growth rate in the expansion\ncoefficients are found to correspond to imperfect bifurcations observed when\nfamilies of standing waves are computed using a shooting method. A direct\nconnection between small divisors in the recursive algorithm and imperfect\nbifurcations in the solution curves is observed, where the small divisor\nexcites higher-frequency parasitic standing waves that oscillate on top of the\nmain wave. A 109th order Pad\\'e approximation maintains 25--30 digits of\naccuracy on both sides of the first imperfect bifurcation encountered for the\nunit-depth problem. This suggests that even if the Stokes expansion is\ndivergent, there may be a closely related convergent sequence of rational\napproximations.",

                "summary": "The proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is tasked with\nthe detection and characterization of gravitational waves from various sources\nin the universe. This endeavor is challenged by transient displacement and\nacceleration noise artifacts, commonly called glitches. Uncalibrated glitches\nimpact the interferometric measurements and decrease the signal quality of\nLISA's time-delay interferometry (TDI) data used for astrophysical data\nanalysis. The paper introduces a novel calibration pipeline that employs a\nneural network ensemble to detect, characterize, and mitigate transient\nglitches of diverse morphologies. A convolutional neural network is designed\nfor anomaly detection, accurately identifying and temporally pinpointing\nanomalies within the TDI time series. Then, a hybrid neural network is\ndeveloped to differentiate between gravitational wave bursts and glitches,\nwhile a long short-term memory (LSTM) network architecture is deployed for\nglitch estimation. The LSTM network acts as a TDI inverter by processing noisy\nTDI data to obtain the underlying glitch dynamics. Finally, the inferred noise\ntransient is subtracted from the interferometric measurements, enhancing data\nintegrity and reducing biases in the parameter estimation of astronomical\ntargets. We propose a low-latency solution featuring generalized LSTM networks\nprimed for rapid response data processing and alert service in high-demand\nscenarios like predicting binary black hole mergers. The research highlights\nthe critical role of machine learning in advancing methodologies for data\ncalibration and astrophysical analysis in LISA.",

                "summary": "We present a lightweight and affordable motion capture method based on two\nsmartwatches and a head-mounted camera. In contrast to the existing approaches\nthat use six or more expert-level IMU devices, our approach is much more\ncost-effective and convenient. Our method can make wearable motion capture\naccessible to everyone everywhere, enabling 3D full-body motion capture in\ndiverse environments. As a key idea to overcome the extreme sparsity and\nambiguities of sensor inputs with different modalities, we integrate 6D head\nposes obtained from the head-mounted cameras for motion estimation. To enable\ncapture in expansive indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose an algorithm to\ntrack and update floor level changes to define head poses, coupled with a\nmulti-stage Transformer-based regression module. We also introduce novel\nstrategies leveraging visual cues of egocentric images to further enhance the\nmotion capture quality while reducing ambiguities. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our method on various challenging scenarios, including complex\noutdoor environments and everyday motions including object interactions and\nsocial interactions among multiple individuals.",

Models based on this approach can explain the hierarchies of the quark\nmasses and CKM mixing between third and light families if these fields are\nlocalised on different sites by the presence of hierarchical new physics\nscales. The model leads to an accidental global $U(2)_q\\times U(3)_u\\times\nU(3)_d$ flavour symmetry which prevents dangerously large effects in flavour\nobservables, making a TeV extension of the SM possible. Given the structure of\nthe PMNS matrix in the neutrino sector, we explore different possibilities for\nthe arrangement of the leptons on the two sites, and consider different models\nwith $U(2)_{\\ell}$ or $U(3)_{\\ell}$ flavour symmetries. The phenomenology of\nthe models is mostly governed by a massive vector triplet of $SU(2)_L$. We\nstudy the interesting interplay between LHC searches and precision observables.\nIn particular, one of the models can give a sizeable lepton flavour universal\neffect in the Wilson coefficient $C_9$ while naturally suppressing\ncontributions to $C_{10}$, as suggested by current $b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ data,\npredicting simultaneously a mild positive shift in the $W$ boson mass.",

Addressing this\ngap, we introduce the contrastive loss into text generation models, presenting\nthe COntrastive-Streamlined MultimOdal framework (\\ModelName), strategically\npartitioning the language model into dedicated unimodal text processing and\nadept multimodal data handling components. \\ModelName, our unified framework,\nmerges unimodal and multimodal elements, enhancing model performance for tasks\ninvolving textual and visual data while notably reducing learnable parameters.\nHowever, these models demand extensive long-text datasets, yet the availability\nof high-quality long-text video datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap,\nthis work introduces \\VideoDatasetName, an inaugural interleaved video-text\ndataset featuring comprehensive captions, marking a significant step forward.\nDemonstrating its impact, we illustrate how \\VideoDatasetName{} enhances model\nperformance in image-text tasks. With 34% learnable parameters and utilizing\n72\\% of the available data, our model demonstrates significant superiority over\nOpenFlamingo~\\cite{openflamingo}.

                "summary": "Given the difficulty of manually annotating motion in video, the current best\nmotion estimation methods are trained with synthetic data, and therefore\nstruggle somewhat due to a train/test gap. Self-supervised methods hold the\npromise of training directly on real video, but typically perform worse. These\ninclude methods trained with warp error (i.e., color constancy) combined with\nsmoothness terms, and methods that encourage cycle-consistency in the estimates\n(i.e., tracking backwards should yield the opposite trajectory as tracking\nforwards). In this work, we take on the challenge of improving state-of-the-art\nsupervised models with self-supervised training. We find that when the\ninitialization is supervised weights, most existing self-supervision techniques\nactually make performance worse instead of better, which suggests that the\nbenefit of seeing the new data is overshadowed by the noise in the training\nsignal. Focusing on obtaining a \"clean\" training signal from real-world\nunlabelled video, we propose to separate label-making and training into two\ndistinct stages. In the first stage, we use the pre-trained model to estimate\nmotion in a video, and then select the subset of motion estimates which we can\nverify with cycle-consistency. This produces a sparse but accurate\npseudo-labelling of the video. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model to\nreproduce these outputs, while also applying augmentations on the input. We\ncomplement this boot-strapping method with simple techniques that densify and\nre-balance the pseudo-labels, ensuring that we do not merely train on \"easy\"\ntracks. We show that our method yields reliable gains over fully-supervised\nmethods in real videos, for both short-term (flow-based) and long-range\n(multi-frame) pixel tracking.",

                "summary": "Window-based transformers excel in large-scale point cloud understanding by\ncapturing context-aware representations with affordable attention computation\nin a more localized manner. However, the sparse nature of point clouds leads to\na significant variance in the number of voxels per window. Existing methods\ngroup the voxels in each window into fixed-length sequences through extensive\nsorting and padding operations, resulting in a non-negligible computational and\nmemory overhead. In this paper, we introduce ScatterFormer, which to the best\nof our knowledge, is the first to directly apply attention to voxels across\ndifferent windows as a single sequence. The key of ScatterFormer is a Scattered\nLinear Attention (SLA) module, which leverages the pre-computation of key-value\npairs in linear attention to enable parallel computation on the variable-length\nvoxel sequences divided by windows. Leveraging the hierarchical structure of\nGPUs and shared memory, we propose a chunk-wise algorithm that reduces the SLA\nmodule's latency to less than 1 millisecond on moderate GPUs. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a cross-window interaction module that improves the locality and\nconnectivity of voxel features across different windows, eliminating the need\nfor extensive window shifting. Our proposed ScatterFormer demonstrates 73.8 mAP\n(L2) on the Waymo Open Dataset and 72.4 NDS on the NuScenes dataset, running at\nan outstanding detection rate of 23 FPS.The code is available at\n\\href{https://github.com/skyhehe123/ScatterFormer}{https://github.com/skyhehe123/ScatterFormer}.",

                "summary": "Using the Hydro-Coal-Frag model that combines hydrodynamics at low $p_{\\rm\nT}$, quark coalescence at intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$, and the LBT transport model\nat high $p_{\\rm T}$, we study the spectra and elliptic flow of identified\nhadrons in high multiplicity p--Pb and p--p collisions at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). In p--Pb collisions, the Hydro-Coal-Frag model gives a good\ndescription of the differential elliptic flow over the $p_{\\rm T}$ range from 0\nto 6 GeV and the approximate number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling at\nintermediate $p_{\\rm T}$. Although Hydro-Coal-Frag model can also roughly\ndescribe the elliptic flow in high multiplicity p--p collisions with the quark\ncoalescence process, the larger contribution from the string fragmentations\nleads to a notable violation of the NCQ scaling of $v_2$ at intermediate\n$p_{\\rm T}$ as observed in the experiment. Comparison runs of the Hydro-Frag\nmodel without the coalescence process demonstrate that regardless the parameter\nadjustments, the Hydro-Frag model cannot simultaneously describe the $p_{\\rm\nT}$ spectra and the elliptic flow of identified hadrons in either p--Pb\ncollisions or p--p collisions. The calculations in this paper thus provide\nsupport for the existence of partonic degrees of freedom and the possible\nformation of the QGP in the small systems created at the LHC.",

The tidal and frame\ndragging sectors of the Weyl tensor must inevitably both be present in this\ndynamic environment, as they mutually induce each other. The frame dragging\neffect is able to impress vorticity onto the plasma current arising due to the\nmass disparity between electrons and protons, which in turn begets a magnetic\nfield from none.

                "summary": "Data assimilation (DA) plays a pivotal role in diverse applications, ranging\nfrom climate predictions and weather forecasts to trajectory planning for\nautonomous vehicles. A prime example is the widely used ensemble Kalman filter\n(EnKF), which relies on linear updates to minimize variance among the ensemble\nof forecast states. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of deep\nlearning approaches in this domain, primarily within a supervised learning\nframework. However, the adaptability of such models to untrained scenarios\nremains a challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel DA strategy that\nutilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to apply state corrections using full or\npartial observations of the state variables. Our investigation focuses on\ndemonstrating this approach to the chaotic Lorenz '63 system, where the agent's\nobjective is to minimize the root-mean-squared error between the observations\nand corresponding forecast states. Consequently, the agent develops a\ncorrection strategy, enhancing model forecasts based on available system state\nobservations. Our strategy employs a stochastic action policy, enabling a Monte\nCarlo-based DA framework that relies on randomly sampling the policy to\ngenerate an ensemble of assimilated realizations. Results demonstrate that the\ndeveloped RL algorithm performs favorably when compared to the EnKF.\nAdditionally, we illustrate the agent's capability to assimilate non-Gaussian\ndata, addressing a significant limitation of the EnKF.",

Due to the combinatorial complexity, the solving\nspeed of hybrid MPC can be insufficient for real-time applications. In this\npaper, we proposed a hybrid MPC solver based on Generalized Benders\nDecomposition (GBD). The algorithm enumerates and stores cutting planes online\ninside a finite buffer. After a short cold-start phase, the stored cuts provide\nwarm-starts for the new problem instances to enhance the solving speed. Despite\nthe disturbance and randomly changing environment, the solving speed maintains.\nLeveraging on the sparsity of feasibility cuts, we also propose a fast\nalgorithm for Benders master problems. Our solver is validated through\ncontrolling a cart-pole system with randomly moving soft contact walls, and a\nfree-flying robot navigating around obstacles. The results show that with\nsignificantly less data than previous works, the solver reaches competitive\nspeeds to the off-the-shelf solver Gurobi despite the Python overhead.",

SCC values are\ndisproportionately high for less-developed, populous countries. Assessing the\ncontributions of urban and non-urban areas to the SCC can provide additional\ninsights for climate policy. Cities are essential for defining global\nemissions, influencing warming levels and associated damages. High exposure and\nconcurrent socioenvironmental problems exacerbate climate change risks in\ncities. Using a spatially explicit integrated assessment model, the SCC is\nestimated at USD$137-USD$579/tCO2, rising to USD$262-USD$1,075/tCO2 when\nincluding urban heat island (UHI) warming. Urban SCC dominates, with both urban\nexposure and the UHI contributing significantly. A permanent 1% reduction of\nthe UHI in urban areas yields net present benefits of USD$484-USD$1,562 per\nurban dweller. Global cities have significant leverage and incentives for a\nswift transition to a low-carbon economy, and for reducing local warming.",

We demonstrate that the\ngravitational potential from the Earth can change the density distribution and\nphase distribution of the condensate's wave function. As time evolves, a\nportion of the gravitational potential energy of the microscopic particles can\nbe converted into kinetic energy, which changes the motion of the microscopic\nparticles, and leads to the varying of the density and phase distribution of\nthe wave function. Nevertheless, the influences of the Earth's gravity on the\nwave function can be eliminated by the micro-gravity environment, which\nconfirmed by many micro-gravity cold atom experiments. Our results present the\ninfluences of gravity and other parameters on interference of Bose-Einstein\ncondensates, which help us to reveal the intrinsic natures of the related\ntheoretical predictions and experimental phenomena. Furthermore, our work\nbuilds a bridge between the related physical phenomena and our physical\nintuition about the Bose-Einstein condensates in micro-gravity environment.",

                "summary": "Self-supervised pre-training paradigms have been extensively explored in the\nfield of skeleton-based action recognition. In particular, methods based on\nmasked prediction have pushed the performance of pre-training to a new height.\nHowever, these methods take low-level features, such as raw joint coordinates\nor temporal motion, as prediction targets for the masked regions, which is\nsuboptimal. In this paper, we show that using high-level contextualized\nfeatures as prediction targets can achieve superior performance. Specifically,\nwe propose Skeleton2vec, a simple and efficient self-supervised 3D action\nrepresentation learning framework, which utilizes a transformer-based teacher\nencoder taking unmasked training samples as input to create latent\ncontextualized representations as prediction targets. Benefiting from the\nself-attention mechanism, the latent representations generated by the teacher\nencoder can incorporate the global context of the entire training samples,\nleading to a richer training task. Additionally, considering the high temporal\ncorrelations in skeleton sequences, we propose a motion-aware tube masking\nstrategy which divides the skeleton sequence into several tubes and performs\npersistent masking within each tube based on motion priors, thus forcing the\nmodel to build long-range spatio-temporal connections and focus on\naction-semantic richer regions. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and\nPKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our proposed Skeleton2vec outperforms\nprevious methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.",

In comparison with previous stacking techniques, the method presented\nhere introduces proper normalization of the shifted redistribution matrix file\n(RMF), which allows to recover the physical temperature and metallicity of the\nstacked spectra. Using this technique, we can obtain constraints in the stacked\nspectra for the individual abundances of O, Ne, Mg, Si, Ar, Ca, and Fe.\nAdditionally, we study the possible detection of the previously reported 3.5keV\nunidentified line emission; however, the residuals barely exceed $\\pm 2 \\sigma$\nin the [3-4]keV range. On the other hand, although residuals in the\n[3.4-3.55]keV band are compatible with charge exchange emission from SXVI (bare\nsulphur ions), charge exchange emission from OVII at 0.56keV should also be\npresent, since it is 200 orders of magnitude higher than charge emission from\nSXVI in the [3.4-3.55]keV band; however, it is unfortunately not detected.",

The ability to create and edit complex 3D shapes has been of key\nimportance in Computer-Aided Design, Animation, Architecture, and\nEntertainment. With the growing popularity of Virtual and Augmented Reality,\nnew applications and tools have been developed for artistic content creation;\nreal-time interactive shape modeling has become increasingly important for a\ncontinuum of virtual and augmented reality environments (eXtended Reality\n(XR)). Shape modeling in XR opens new possibilities for intuitive design and\nshape modeling in an accessible way. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches\ngenerating shape information from text prompts are set to change how artists\ncreate and edit 3D models. There has been a substantial body of research on\ninteractive 3D shape modeling. However, there is no recent extensive review of\nthe existing techniques and what AI shape generation means for shape modeling\nin interactive XR environments. In this state-of-the-art paper, we fill this\nresearch gap in the literature by surveying free-form shape modeling work in\nXR, with a focus on sculpting and 3D sketching, the most intuitive forms of\nfree-form shape modeling. We classify and discuss these works across five\ndimensions: contribution of the articles, domain setting, interaction tool,\nauto-completion, and collaborative designing. The paper concludes by discussing\nthe disconnect between interactive 3D sculpting and sketching and how this will\nlikely evolve with the prevalence of AI shape-generation tools in the future.",

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nan innovative method of leukocyte detection: the Multi-level Feature Fusion and\nDeformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR). To tackle the issue of leukocyte\nscale disparity, we designed the High-level Screening-feature Fusion Pyramid\n(HS-FPN), enabling multi-level fusion. This model uses high-level features as\nweights to filter low-level feature information via a channel attention module\nand then merges the screened information with the high-level features, thus\nenhancing the model's feature expression capability. Further, we address the\nissue of leukocyte feature scarcity by incorporating a multi-scale deformable\nself-attention module in the encoder and using the self-attention and\ncross-deformable attention mechanisms in the decoder, which aids in the\nextraction of the global features of the leukocyte feature maps. The\neffectiveness, superiority, and generalizability of the proposed MFDS-DETR\nmethod are confirmed through comparisons with other cutting-edge leukocyte\ndetection models using the private WBCDD, public LISC and BCCD datasets. Our\nsource code and private WBCCD dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/JustlfC03/MFDS-DETR.",

                "summary": "Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations, which rely entirely on\npublicly available data such as social media, play an increasingly important\nrole in solving crimes and holding governments accountable. The growing volume\nof data and complex nature of tasks, however, means there is a pressing need to\nscale and speed up OSINT investigations. Expert-led crowdsourcing approaches\nshow promise but tend to either focus on narrow tasks or domains or require\nresource-intense, long-term relationships between expert investigators and\ncrowds. We address this gap by providing a flexible framework that enables\ninvestigators across domains to enlist crowdsourced support for the discovery\nand verification of OSINT. We use a design-based research (DBR) approach to\ndevelop OSINT Research Studios (ORS), a sociotechnical system in which novice\ncrowds are trained to support professional investigators with complex OSINT\ninvestigations. Through our qualitative evaluation, we found that ORS\nfacilitates ethical and effective OSINT investigations across multiple domains.\nWe also discuss broader implications of expert-crowd collaboration and\nopportunities for future work.",

The goal is to equip robots\nwith the ability to reliably receive objects with unseen geometry handed over\nby humans in various complex trajectories. We acquire such generalizability by\nlearning H2R handover at scale with a comprehensive solution including\nprocedural simulation assets creation, automated demonstration generation, and\neffective imitation learning. We leverage large-scale 3D model repositories,\ndexterous grasp generation methods, and curve-based 3D animation to create an\nH2R handover simulation environment named \\simabbns, surpassing the number of\nscenes in existing simulators by three orders of magnitude. We further\nintroduce a distillation-friendly demonstration generation method that\nautomatically generates a million high-quality demonstrations suitable for\nlearning. Finally, we present a 4D imitation learning method augmented by a\nfuture forecasting objective to distill demonstrations into a visuo-motor\nhandover policy. Experimental evaluations in both simulators and the real world\ndemonstrate significant improvements (at least +10\\% success rate) over\nbaselines in all cases.

                "summary": "The high energy (Regge) limit provides a playground for understanding all\nloop structures of scattering amplitudes, and plays an important role in the\ndescription of many phenomenologically relevant cross-sections. While well\nunderstood in the planar limit, the structure of non-planar corrections\nintroduces many fascinating complexities, for which a general organizing\nprinciple is still lacking. We study the structure of multi-reggeon exchanges\nin the context of the effective field theory for forward scattering, and derive\ntheir factorization into collinear operators (impact factors) and soft\noperators. We derive the structure of the renormalization group consistency\nequations in the effective theory, showing how the anomalous dimensions of the\nsoft operators are related to those of the collinear operators, allowing us to\nderive renormalization group equations in the Regge limit purely from a\ncollinear perspective. The rigidity of the consistency equations provides\nconsiderable insight into the all orders organization of Regge amplitudes in\nthe effective theory, as well as its relation to other approaches. Along the\nway we derive a number of technical results that improve the understanding of\nthe effective theory. We illustrate this collinear perspective by re-deriving\nall the standard BFKL equations for two-Glauber exchange from purely collinear\ncalculations, and we show that this perspective provides a number of conceptual\nand computational advantages as compared to the standard view from soft or\nGlauber physics. We anticipate that this formulation in terms of collinear\noperators will enable a better understanding of the relation between BFKL and\nDGLAP in gauge theories, and facilitate the analysis of renormalization group\nevolution equations describing Reggeization beyond next-to-leading order.",

We apply this framework to study\ngravitational wave generation and propagation from extreme mass-ratio inspirals\nin the presence of several astrophysically relevant dark matter models, namely\nthe Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White, and Einasto profiles. We also study dark\nmatter spike profiles obtained from a fully relativistic calculation of the\nadiabatic growth of a BH within the Hernquist profile, and provide a\nclosed-form analytic fit of these profiles. Our analysis completes prior\nnumerical work in the axial sector, yielding a fully numerical pipeline to\nstudy black hole environmental effects. We study the dependence of the fluxes\non the DM halo mass and compactness. We find that, unlike the axial case, polar\nfluxes are not adequately described by simple gravitational-redshift effects,\nthus offering an exciting avenue for the study of black hole environments with\ngravitational waves.",

With deep multi-band NIRCam\nimages in GOODS-South from JADES, we measure the effective radii ($R_e$) of the\ngalaxies at rest-frame 0.3, 0.5 and 1$\\mu m$. On average, QGs are 45% (15%)\nmore compact at rest-frame 1$\\mu m$ than they are at 0.3$\\mu m$ (0.5$\\mu m$).\nRegardless of wavelengths, the $R_e$ of QGs strongly evolves with redshift, and\nthis evolution depends on stellar mass. For lower-mass QGs with\n$M_*=10^{10}-10^{10.6}M_\\odot$, the evolution follows $R_e\\sim(1+z)^{-1.1}$,\nwhereas it becomes steeper, following $R_e\\sim(1+z)^{-1.7}$, for higher-mass\nQGs with $M_*>10^{10.6}M_\\odot$. To constrain the physical mechanisms driving\nthe apparent size evolution, we study the relationship between $R_e$ and the\nformation redshift ($z_{form}$) of QGs. For lower-mass QGs, this relationship\nis broadly consistent with $R_e\\sim(1+z_{form})^{-1}$, in line with the\nexpectation of the progenitor effect. For higher-mass QGs, the relationship\nbetween $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ depends on stellar age. Older QGs have a steeper\nrelationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ than that expected from the\nprogenitor effect alone, suggesting that mergers and/or post-quenching\ncontinuous gas accretion drive additional size growth in very massive systems.\nWe find that the $z>3$ QGs in our sample are very compact, with mass surface\ndensities $\\Sigma_e\\gtrsim10^{10} M_\\odot/\\rm{kpc}^2$, and their $R_e$ are\npossibly even smaller than anticipated from the size evolution measured for\nlower-redshift QGs. Finally, we take a close look at the structure of GS-9209,\none of the earliest confirmed massive QGs at $z_{spec}\\sim4.7$. From UV to NIR,\nGS-9209 becomes increasingly compact, and its light profile becomes more\nspheroidal, showing that the color gradient is already present in this earliest\nmassive QG.",

It operates in a bottom-up fashion,\nanalogous to classical methods for sub-pixel edge localization and\nedge-linking, but with a higher-dimensional representation of local boundary\nstructure, and notions of local scale and spatial consistency that are learned\ninstead of designed. Our network uses a mechanism that we call boundary\nattention: a geometry-aware local attention operation that, when applied\ndensely and repeatedly, progressively refines a pixel-resolution field of\nvariables that specify the boundary structure in every overlapping patch within\nan image. Unlike many edge detectors that produce rasterized binary edge maps,\nour model provides a rich, unrasterized representation of the geometric\nstructure in every local region. We find that its intentional geometric bias\nallows it to be trained on simple synthetic shapes and then generalize to\nextracting boundaries from noisy low-light photographs.",

                "summary": "The importance of the information in the direct sound to human perception of\nspatial sound sources is an ongoing research topic. The classification between\ndirect sound and diffuse or reverberant sound forms the basis of numerous\nstudies in the field of spatial audio. In particular, parametric spatial audio\nrepresentation methods use this classification and employ signal processing in\norder to enhance the audio quality at reproduction. However, current literature\ndoes not provide information concerning the impact of ideal direct sound\nrepresentation on externalization, in the context of Ambisonics. This paper\naims to assess the importance of the spatial information in the direct sound in\nthe externalization of a sound field when using binaural reproduction. This is\ndone in the spherical harmonics (SH) domain, where an ideal direct sound\nrepresentation within an otherwise Ambisonics signal is simulated, and its\nperceived externalization is evaluated in a formal listening test. This\ninvestigation leads to the conclusion that externalization of a first order\nAmbisonics signal may be significantly improved by enhancing the direct sound\ncomponent, up to a level similar to a third order Ambisonics signal.",

We successfully extract the bulk\nmetric from the boundary holographic optical conductivity.

                "summary": "Energetic and optical properties of plasmonic nanocrystals strongly depend on\ntheir sizes, shapes, and composition. Whereas using plasmonic nanoparticles in\nbiotesting has become routine, applications of plasmonics in energy are still\nearly in development. Here, we investigate hot electron (HE) generation and\nrelated electromagnetic effects in both mono- and bi-metallic nanorods (NRs)\nand focus on one promising type of bi-metallic nanocrystals - core-shell Au-Ag\nnanorods. The spectra of the NRs are broadband, highly tunable with their\ngeometry, and have few plasmon resonances. In this work, we provide a new\nquantum formalism describing the HE generation in bi-metallic nanostructures.\nInterestingly, we observe that the HE generation rate at the UV plasmon\nresonance of Au-Ag NRs appears to be very high. These HEs are highly energetic\nand suitable for carbon-fuel reactions. Simultaneously, the HE generation at\nthe longitudinal plasmon (L-plasmon) peaks, which can be tuned from the yellow\nto near-IR, depends on the near-field and electromagnetic Mie effects, limiting\nthe HE efficiencies for the long and large NRs. These properties of the\nL-plasmon relate to all kinds of NRs (Au, Ag, and Au-Ag). We also consider the\ngeneration of the interband d-holes in Au and Ag, since the involvement of the\nd-band is crucial for the energetic properties of UV plasmons. The proposed\nformalism is an important development for the description of bi-metallic (or\ntri-metallic, or more complex) nanostructures, and it paves the way to the\nefficient application of the plasmonic HEs and hot holes in sensing,\nnanotechnology, photocatalysis, and electrophotochemistry.",

We also discuss some related methods like stochastic\napproximation and Monte Carlo maximum likelihood. Generating the Monte Carlo\nsamples necessary for these methods is, in general, a hard problem. As such, we\nreview several simulation strategies which can be used to address this\nchallenge.\n  Given the wide range of methods available for approximating the EM, it can be\nchallenging to select which one to use. We review numerous comparisons between\nthese methods from a wide range of sources, and offer guidance on synthesizing\nthe findings.

                "summary": "The laws that govern the nature often set certain limits or bans. Approaching\nthose limits is a common paradigm of breakthroughs in human knowledge and\ntechnological application, such as time slowing to a stop as one approaches the\nspeed of light, electrons flowing freely with no resistance as one approaches\nthe absolute zero, and an event horizon arising as one approaches a black hole.\nA well-known ban concerning the statistical mechanics of cooperative phenomena,\nsuch as ice melting into water, is the nonexistence of phase transition at\nfinite temperature in the Ising model with short-range interactions in one\ndimension. Yet, little is known about whether this forbidden transition could\nbe approached arbitrarily closely at fixed finite temperature. To explore such\nasymptoticity, the notion of marginal phase transition (MPT) was introduced\nrecently, and both the spontaneous MPT and the field-induced MPT were\ndiscovered respectively in ladder and single-chain Ising models decorated with\ngeometric frustration. Here I push the limit down to the minimal single-chain\nIsing model -- without geometric frustration -- in a magnetic field; then, a\nhidden frustration is revealed to drive the first-order MPT with large latent\nheat. Furthermore, as one approaches the zero field, MPT appears continuous\nwith no latent heat, displays abrupt change in sublattice magnetization and a\nkink-like minimum in overall magnetization with temperature, and vanishes when\nthe field drops below a threshold. These findings deepen our understanding of\ncooperative phenomena via the doubly forbidden and open new avenues to the\ndesign and engineering of the Ising systems with the different types of MPT for\nexploring exotic phenomena and low-dimensional device applications.",

The intra-class correlation of\nthe approximating beta-binomial depends on $\\Pr(X_1 \\leq X_0)$ and $\\Pr(X_1\n\\leq X_0, X_2 \\leq X_0)$.

                "summary": "The study of cometary composition is important for understanding our solar\nsystem's early evolutionary processes. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a common\nhypervolatile in comets that can drive activity but is more difficult to study\nthan other hypervolatiles due to severe telluric absorption. CO2 can only be\ndirectly observed from space-borne assets. Therefore, a proxy is needed to\nmeasure CO2 abundances in comets using ground-based observations. The flux\nratio of the [O I] 5577 A line to the sum of the [O I] 6300 A and [O I] 6364 A\nlines (hereafter referred to as the [O I] line ratio) has, with some success,\nbeen used in the past as such a proxy. We present an [O I] line ratio analysis\nof comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdu\\v{s}\\'akov\\'a (HMP), using data obtained with\nthe Tull Coud\\'e Spectrograph on the 2.7-meter Harlan J. Smith telescope at\nMcDonald Observatory, taken from UT February 21-23, 2017 when the comet was at\nheliocentric distances of 1.12-1.15 AU. HMP is a hyperactive Jupiter family\ncomet (JFC). Icy grains driven out by CO2 sublimation have been proposed as a\ndriver of hyperactivity, but the CO2 abundance of HMP has not been measured.\nFrom our [O I] line ratio measurements, we find a CO2/H2O ratio for HMP of 22.9\n+/- 1.4%. We compare the CO2/H2O ratios to the active fractions of the nine\ncomets (including HMP) in the literature that have data for both values. We\nfind no correlation. These findings imply that CO2 sublimation driving out icy\ngrains is not the only factor influencing active fractions for cometary nuclei.",

We examine high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra\nof six stars in the Cygnus Loop region with distances greater than ~700 pc. All\nstars show low-velocity Na I and Ca II absorption. However, only one star, HD\n198301, exhibits high-velocity Ca II absorption components, at velocities of\n+62, +82, and +96 km/s. The distance to this star of ~870 pc helps to constrain\nthe distance to the receding edge of the Cygnus Loop's expanding shock front.\nOne of our targets, HD 335334, was previously thought to exhibit high positive\nand high negative velocity interstellar Na I and Ca II absorption. This was one\nfactor leading Fesen et al. to derive a distance to the Cygnus Loop of 725 pc.\nHowever, we find that HD 335334 is in fact a double-line spectroscopic binary\nand shows no evidence of high-velocity interstellar absorption. As such, the\ndistance to HD 335334 cannot be used to constrain the distance to the Cygnus\nLoop. Our detection of Ca II absorption approaching 100 km/s toward HD 198301\nis the first conclusive detection of high-velocity absorption from a low\nionization species associated with the Cygnus Loop SNR. A large jump in the Na\nI column density toward BD+31 4218, a star located beyond the northwestern\nboundary of the Cygnus Loop, helps to constrain the distance to a large\nmolecular cloud complex with which the Cygnus Loop is evidently interacting.",

                "summary": "Cold, neutral interstellar gas, the reservoir for star formation, is traced\nthrough the absorption of the 21-centimetre continuum radiation by neutral\nhydrogen (HI). Although detected in one hundred cases in the host galaxies of\ndistant radio sources, only recently have column densities approaching the\nmaximum value observed in Lyman-alpha absorption systems been found. Here we\nexplore the implications these have for the hypothesis that the detection rate\nof HI absorption is dominated by photo-ionisation from the active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). We find, with the addition all of the current searches for HI\nabsorption at z > 0.1, a strong correlation between the HI absorption strength\nand the ionising photon rate, with the maximum value at which HI is detected\nremaining close to the theoretical value in which all of the neutral gas would\nbe ionised in a large spiral galaxy (Q = 2.9e56 ionising photons/s). We also\nrule out other effects (excitation by the radio continuum and changing gas\nproperties) as the dominant cause for the decrease in the detection rate with\nredshift. Furthermore, from the maximum theoretical column density we find that\nthe five high column density systems have spin temperatures close to those of\nthe Milky Way (T < 300 K), whereas, from our model of a gaseous galactic disk,\nthe HI detection at Q= 2.9e56 per s yields T~10 000 K, consistent with the gas\nbeing highly ionised.",

Although the use of\nverification-aware languages, such as Dafny, has increased considerably in the\nlast decade, these are still not widely adopted. Often the cost of using such\nlanguages is too high, due to the level of expertise required from the\ndevelopers and challenges that they often face when trying to prove a program\ncorrect. Even though Dafny automates a lot of the verification process,\nsometimes there are steps that are too complex for Dafny to perform on its own.\nOne such case is that of missing lemmas, i.e. Dafny is unable to prove a result\nwithout being given further help in the form of a theorem that can assist it in\nthe proof of the step.\n  In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that\nleverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant\nlemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use. Moreover, for the lemmas that\ncannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide\naccompanying calculational proofs. We also discuss ideas for future work by\ndescribing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of\nverification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity\nand by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal\nspecifications and proving program properties.",

However, poor model generalization, due to varying environmental\nconditions and sensing hardware, is a well-known problem in this space. To\naddress this issue, in this work, data augmentation techniques commonly used in\nimage-based learning are applied to WiFi CSI to investigate their effects on\nmodel generalization performance in cross-scenario and cross-system settings.\nIn particular, we focus on the generalization between line-of-sight (LOS) and\nnon-line-of-sight (NLOS) through-wall scenarios, as well as on the\ngeneralization between different antenna systems, which remains under-explored.\nWe collect and make publicly available a dataset of CSI amplitude spectrograms\nof human activities. Utilizing this data, an ablation study is conducted in\nwhich activity recognition models based on the EfficientNetV2 architecture are\ntrained, allowing us to assess the effects of each augmentation on model\ngeneralization performance. The gathered results show that specific\ncombinations of simple data augmentation techniques applied to CSI amplitude\ndata can significantly improve cross-scenario and cross-system generalization.",

Specifically, the pre-nonrelativistic and the pre-ultralocal\nparametrizations can be constructed from the gauging of the Galilei and Carroll\nalgebras, respectively. Also, the pre-ultralocal approach of taking the\nCarrollian limit is equivalent to performing the ADM decomposition and then\nsetting the signature of the Lorentzian manifold to zero. We use this\nuniqueness to write a generic expansion for the curvature tensors and construct\nGalilean and Carrollian limits of all metric theories of gravity of finite\norder ranging from the $f(R)$ gravity to a completely generic higher derivative\ntheory, the $f(g_{\\mu\\nu},R_{\\mu\\nu\\sigma \\rho},\\nabla_{\\mu})$ gravity. We\npresent an algorithm for calculation of the $n$-th order of the Galilean and\nCarrollian expansions that transforms this problem into a constrained\noptimization problem. We also derive the condition under which a gravitational\ntheory becomes a modification of general relativity in both limits\nsimultaneously.",

                "summary": "Objective: Blood transfusions, crucial in managing anemia and coagulopathy in\nICU settings, require accurate prediction for effective resource allocation and\npatient risk assessment. However, existing clinical decision support systems\nhave primarily targeted a particular patient demographic with unique medical\nconditions and focused on a single type of blood transfusion. This study aims\nto develop an advanced machine learning-based model to predict the probability\nof transfusion necessity over the next 24 hours for a diverse range of\nnon-traumatic ICU patients.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 72,072 adult\nnon-traumatic ICU patients admitted to a high-volume US metropolitan academic\nhospital between 2016 and 2020. We developed a meta-learner and various machine\nlearning models to serve as predictors, training them annually with four-year\ndata and evaluating on the fifth, unseen year, iteratively over five years.\n  Results: The experimental results revealed that the meta-model surpasses the\nother models in different development scenarios. It achieved notable\nperformance metrics, including an Area Under the Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.97, an accuracy rate of 0.93, and an F1-score\nof 0.89 in the best scenario.\n  Conclusion: This study pioneers the use of machine learning models for\npredicting blood transfusion needs in a diverse cohort of critically ill\npatients. The findings of this evaluation confirm that our model not only\npredicts transfusion requirements effectively but also identifies key\nbiomarkers for making transfusion decisions.",

Existing studies focused on\nthe utility of a single family of generative models.

In this paper, we approach the\ndownstream task-oriented generative model selections problem in the case of\ntraining fraud detection models and investigate the best practice given\ndifferent combinations of model interpretability and model performance\nconstraints. Our investigation supports that, while both Neural\nNetwork(NN)-based and Bayesian Network(BN)-based generative models are both\ngood to complete synthetic training task under loose model interpretability\nconstrain, the BN-based generative models is better than NN-based when\nsynthetic training fraud detection model under strict model interpretability\nconstrain.

                "summary": "We analyse $\\textit{XMM-Newton}$ RGS spectra of Wolf-Rayet (WR) 140, an\narchetype long-period eccentric WR+O colliding wind binary. We evaluate the\nspectra of O and Fe emission lines and find that the plasmas emitting these\nlines have the largest approaching velocities with the largest velocity\ndispersions between phases 0.935 and 0.968 where the inferior conjunction of\nthe O star occurs. This behaviour is the same as that of the Ne line-emission\nplasma presented in our previous paper. We perform diagnosis of electron number\ndensity $n_{\\rm e}$ using He-like triplet lines of O and Ne-like Fe-L lines.\nThe former results in a conservative upper limit of $n_{\\rm e} \\lesssim\n10^{10}$-10$^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ on the O line-emission site, while the latter can\nnot impose any constraint on the Fe line-emission site because of statistical\nlimitations. We calculate the line-of-sight velocity and its dispersion\nseparately along the shock cone. By comparing the observed and calculated\nline-of-sight velocities, we update the distance of the Ne line-emission site\nfrom the stagnation point. By assuming radiative cooling of the Ne\nline-emission plasma using the observed temperature and the local stellar wind\ndensity, we estimate the line-emission site extends along the shock cone by at\nmost $\\pm$58 per cent (phase 0.816) of the distance from the stagnation point.\nIn this framework, excess of the observed velocity dispersion over the\ncalculated one is ascribed to turbulence in the hot-shocked plasma at earlier\norbital phases of 0.816, 0.912, and 0.935, with the largest velocity dispersion\nof 340-630 km s$^{-1}$ at phase 0.912.",

                "summary": "Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) pervade real-world\napplications in science, engineering, and design. Constraint violation has been\na building block in designing evolutionary multi-objective optimization\nalgorithms for solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems.\nHowever, in certain scenarios, constraint functions might be unknown or\ninadequately defined, making constraint violation unattainable and potentially\nmisleading for conventional constrained evolutionary multi-objective\noptimization algorithms. To address this issue, we present the first of its\nkind evolutionary optimization framework, inspired by the principles of the\nalternating direction method of multipliers that decouples objective and\nconstraint functions. This framework tackles CMOPs with unknown constraints by\nreformulating the original problem into an additive form of two subproblems,\neach of which is allotted a dedicated evolutionary population. Notably, these\ntwo populations operate towards complementary evolutionary directions during\ntheir optimization processes. In order to minimize discrepancy, their\nevolutionary directions alternate, aiding the discovery of feasible solutions.\nComparative experiments conducted against five state-of-the-art constrained\nevolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms, on 120 benchmark test\nproblem instances with varying properties, as well as two real-world\nengineering optimization problems, demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of our proposed framework. Its salient features include faster\nconvergence and enhanced resilience to various Pareto front shapes.",

                "summary": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are promising 3D representations for scenes,\nobjects, and humans. However, most existing methods require multi-view inputs\nand per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover,\ncurrent methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting\nhands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations\nremain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable\nvisibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically,\ngiven an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a\nmesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric\nand textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the\nvisibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge\nfeatures of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas.\nAdditionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator\nwithin an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional\ndiscriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image,\nthe proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing\nfine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to\nimprove the visual quality of synthesized images. Experiments on the\nInterhand2.6M dataset demonstrate that our proposed VA-NeRF outperforms\nconventional NeRFs significantly. Project Page:\n\\url{https://github.com/XuanHuang0/VANeRF}.",

Several\nresearch studies demonstrate the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers,\namyloid beta 1-42, T-tau, and P-tau, in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease\nstages. In this work, we used machine learning models to classify different\nstages of Alzheimer's disease based on the cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels\nalone. An electronic health record of patients from the National Alzheimer's\nCoordinating Centre database was analyzed and the patients were subdivided\nbased on mini-mental state scores and clinical dementia ratings. Statistical\nand correlation analyses were performed to identify significant differences\nbetween the Alzheimer's stages. Afterward, machine learning classifiers\nincluding K-Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble Boosted Tree, Ensemble Bagged Tree,\nSupport Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes classifiers were\nemployed to classify the Alzheimer's disease stages. The results demonstrate\nthat Ensemble Boosted Tree (84.4%) and Logistic Regression (73.4%) provide the\nhighest accuracy for binary classification, while Ensemble Bagged Tree (75.4%)\ndemonstrates better accuracy for multiclassification. The findings from this\nresearch are expected to help clinicians in making an informed decision\nregarding the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's from the cerebrospinal fluid\nbiomarkers alone, monitoring of the disease progression, and implementation of\nappropriate intervention measures.",

                "summary": "A hybrid encryption (HE) system is an efficient public key encryption system\nfor arbitrarily long messages. An HE system consists of a public key component\ncalled key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), and a symmetric key component called\ndata encapsulation mechanism (DEM). The HE encryption algorithm uses a KEM\ngenerated key k to encapsulate the message using DEM, and send the ciphertext\ntogether with the encapsulaton of k, to the decryptor who decapsulates k and\nuses it to decapsulate the message using the corresponding KEM and DEM\ncomponents. The KEM/DEM composition theorem proves that if KEM and DEM satisfy\nwell-defined security notions, then HE will be secure with well defined\nsecurity. We introduce HE in correlated randomness model where the encryption\nand decryption algorithms have samples of correlated random variables that are\npartially leaked to the adversary. Security of the new KEM/DEM paradigm is\ndefined against computationally unbounded or polynomially bounded adversaries.\nWe define iKEM and cKEM with respective information theoretic computational\nsecurity, and prove a composition theorem for them and a computationally secure\nDEM, resulting in secure HEs with proved computational security (CPA and CCA)\nand without any computational assumption. We construct two iKEMs that provably\nsatisfy the required security notions of the composition theorem. The iKEMs are\nused to construct two efficient quantum-resistant HEs when used with an AES\nbased DEM. We also define and construct combiners with proved security that\ncombine the new KEM/DEM paradigm of HE with the traditional public key based\nparadigm of HE.",

                "summary": "Stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background (SGWB) contains information\nabout the early Universe and astrophysical processes. The recent evidence of\nSGWB by pulsar timing arrays in the nanohertz band is a breakthrough in the GW\nastronomy. For ground-based GW detectors, while in data analysis, the SGWB can\nbe masked by loud GW events from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). Assuming a\nnext-generation ground-based GW detector network, we investigate the potential\nfor detecting the astrophysical and cosmological SGWB with non-CBC origins by\nsubtracting recovered foreground signals of loud CBC events. The Fisher\nInformation Matrix (FIM) method is adopted for quick calculation. As an\nextension of the studies by Sachdev {\\it et al.} (2020) and Zhou {\\it et al.}\n(2023), two more essential features are considered. Firstly, we incorporate\nnon-zero aligned or anti-aligned spin parameters in our waveform model. Because\nof the inclusion of spins, we obtain significantly more pessimistic results\nthan the previous work, where the residual energy density of foreground is even\nlarger than the original CBC foreground. For the most extreme case, we observe\nthat the subtraction results are approximately 10 times worse for binary black\nhole events and 20 times worse for binary neutron star events than the\nscenarios without accounting for spins. The degeneracy between the spin\nparameters and the symmetric mass ratio is strong in the parameter estimation\nprocess, and it contributes most to the imperfect foreground subtraction.\nSecondly, in this work, extreme CBC events with condition numbers of FIMs\n$c_{\\rm{\\Gamma}}>10^{15}$ are preserved. The impacts of these extreme events on\nforeground subtraction are discussed. Our results have important implications\nfor assessing the detectability of SGWB from non-CBC origins for ground-based\nGW detectors.",

In Section 2, we revisit and prove several results on\n(quadratic) algebras over general fields. In Section 3, we show how to develop\nthe spectral theory in the context of complex (resp. real) one-sided\nalternative topological algebras. As an application of the existence of\nspectrum, we prove the existence of nontrivial hyperinvariant linear manifolds\nfor nonscalar (resp. nonquadratic) continuous linear operators acting on\ncomplex (resp. real) Fr\\'echet spaces. Along the way, spectral theory is used\nto prove several topological counterparts of the well-known theorems of\nFrobenius, Hurwitz, Gelfand-Mazur, and Zorn. This is done, for example, in the\ncontext of left (resp. right) alternative topological algebras whose duals\nseparate their elements. In Section 4, we consider real and complex algebras in\nvarious topological settings and reconsider and prove several results. For\ninstance, it is shown that given a $ 1 < k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, on any locally\ncomplex algebra, there exists a unique nonzero vector space norm, say, $\\|.\\|$,\nsatisfying the identity $\\|a^k\\| = \\|a\\|^k$ on the algebra. In Section 5, among\nother things, we revisit and slightly strengthen the celebrated theorems of\nFrobenius, Zorn, Gelfand-Mazur, and Hurwitz, and also give slight extensions of\ntheir topological counterparts, e.g., theorems of Albert, Kaplansky, and\nUrbanik-Wright to name a few, in several settings.",

We motivate estimators for the quantile estimands\nwith the efficient influence function, and develop their asymptotic properties\nwhen either parametric models or data-adaptive machine learners are used to\nestimate the nuisance functions. A broad implication of our results is that one\ncan rework the existing result for mean causal estimands to facilitate causal\ninference on quantiles. Our general results are illustrated by several\nanalytical and numerical examples.",

                "summary": "The rise of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in\nlanguage-based driving tasks. However, existing research typically focuses on\nlimited tasks and often omits key multi-view and temporal information which is\ncrucial for robust autonomous driving. To bridge these gaps, we introduce\nNuInstruct, a novel dataset with 91K multi-view video-QA pairs across 17\nsubtasks, where each task demands holistic information (e.g., temporal,\nmulti-view, and spatial), significantly elevating the challenge level. To\nobtain NuInstruct, we propose a novel SQL-based method to generate\ninstruction-response pairs automatically, which is inspired by the driving\nlogical progression of humans. We further present BEV-InMLLM, an end-to-end\nmethod for efficiently deriving instruction-aware Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)\nfeatures, language-aligned for large language models. BEV-InMLLM integrates\nmulti-view, spatial awareness, and temporal semantics to enhance MLLMs'\ncapabilities on NuInstruct tasks. Moreover, our proposed BEV injection module\nis a plug-and-play method for existing MLLMs. Our experiments on NuInstruct\ndemonstrate that BEV-InMLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, e.g.\naround 9% improvement on various tasks. We plan to release our NuInstruct for\nfuture research development.",

                "summary": "Prompt injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in large language models\n(LLMs) to manipulate the model into unintended actions or generate malicious\ncontent. As LLM integrated applications gain wider adoption, they face growing\nsusceptibility to such attacks. This study introduces a novel evaluation\nframework for quantifying the resilience of applications. The framework\nincorporates innovative techniques designed to ensure representativeness,\ninterpretability, and robustness. To ensure the representativeness of simulated\nattacks on the application, a meticulous selection process was employed,\nresulting in 115 carefully chosen attacks based on coverage and relevance. For\nenhanced interpretability, a second LLM was utilized to evaluate the responses\ngenerated from these simulated attacks. Unlike conventional malicious content\nclassifiers that provide only a confidence score, the LLM-based evaluation\nproduces a score accompanied by an explanation, thereby enhancing\ninterpretability. Subsequently, a resilience score is computed by assigning\nhigher weights to attacks with greater impact, thus providing a robust\nmeasurement of the application resilience. To assess the framework's efficacy,\nit was applied on two LLMs, namely Llama2 and ChatGLM. Results revealed that\nLlama2, the newer model exhibited higher resilience compared to ChatGLM. This\nfinding substantiates the effectiveness of the framework, aligning with the\nprevailing notion that newer models tend to possess greater resilience.\nMoreover, the framework exhibited exceptional versatility, requiring only\nminimal adjustments to accommodate emerging attack techniques and\nclassifications, thereby establishing itself as an effective and practical\nsolution. Overall, the framework offers valuable insights that empower\norganizations to make well-informed decisions to fortify their applications\nagainst potential threats from prompt injection.",

                "summary": "More than 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been detected at\nmulti-bands, which can be viewed as extreme laboratories to investigate the\naccretion physics and gravity in the immediate vicinity of massive black holes.\nFuture transient surveys are expected to detect several tens of thousands of\nTDEs, among which a small fraction may be strongly gravitationally lensed by\nintervening galaxies. In this paper, we statistically etsimate the detection\nrate of lensed TDEs, with dependence on the limiting magnitude of the transient\nall-sky surveys searching for them. We find that the requisite limiting\nmagnitude for an all-sky transient survey to observe at least $1$ yr$^{-1}$ is\n$\\gtrsim 21.3$, $21.2$, and $21.5$ mag in the $u$, $g$, and $z$ bands,\nrespectively. If the limiting magnitude of the all-sky survey can reach $\\sim\n25-26$ mag in the $u$, $g$, and $z$ bands, the detection rate can be upto about\nseveral tens to hundreds per year. The discovery and identification of the\nfirst image of the lensed TDE can be taken as an early warning of the second\nand other subsequent images, which may enable detailed monitoring of the\npre-peak photometry and spectroscopy evolution of the TDE. The additional\nearly-stage information may help to constrain the dynamical and radiation\nprocesses involving in the TDEs.",

                "summary": "The emergence of LLM (Large Language Model) integrated virtual assistants has\nbrought about a rapid transformation in communication dynamics. During virtual\nassistant development, some developers prefer to leverage the system message,\nalso known as an initial prompt or custom prompt, for preconditioning purposes.\nHowever, it is important to recognize that an excessive reliance on this\nfunctionality raises the risk of manipulation by malicious actors who can\nexploit it with carefully crafted prompts. Such malicious manipulation poses a\nsignificant threat, potentially compromising the accuracy and reliability of\nthe virtual assistant's responses. Consequently, safeguarding the virtual\nassistants with detection and defense mechanisms becomes of paramount\nimportance to ensure their safety and integrity. In this study, we explored\nthree detection and defense mechanisms aimed at countering attacks that target\nthe system message. These mechanisms include inserting a reference key,\nutilizing an LLM evaluator, and implementing a Self-Reminder. To showcase the\nefficacy of these mechanisms, they were tested against prominent attack\ntechniques. Our findings demonstrate that the investigated mechanisms are\ncapable of accurately identifying and counteracting the attacks. The\neffectiveness of these mechanisms underscores their potential in safeguarding\nthe integrity and reliability of virtual assistants, reinforcing the importance\nof their implementation in real-world scenarios. By prioritizing the security\nof virtual assistants, organizations can maintain user trust, preserve the\nintegrity of the application, and uphold the high standards expected in this\nera of transformative technologies.",

                "summary": "The size of deep learning models in artificial intelligence (AI) software is\nincreasing rapidly, hindering the large-scale deployment on resource-restricted\ndevices (e.g., smartphones). To mitigate this issue, AI software compression\nplays a crucial role, which aims to compress model size while keeping high\nperformance. However, the intrinsic defects in a big model may be inherited by\nthe compressed one. Such defects may be easily leveraged by adversaries, since\na compressed model is usually deployed in a large number of devices without\nadequate protection. In this article, we aim to address the safe model\ncompression problem from the perspective of safety-performance co-optimization.\nSpecifically, inspired by the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm in\nsoftware engineering, we propose a test-driven sparse training framework called\nSafeCompress. By simulating the attack mechanism as safety testing,\nSafeCompress can automatically compress a big model to a small one following\nthe dynamic sparse training paradigm. Then, considering two kinds of\nrepresentative and heterogeneous attack mechanisms, i.e., black-box membership\ninference attack and white-box membership inference attack, we develop two\nconcrete instances called BMIA-SafeCompress and WMIA-SafeCompress. Further, we\nimplement another instance called MMIA-SafeCompress by extending SafeCompress\nto defend against the occasion when adversaries conduct black-box and white-box\nmembership inference attacks simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments\non five datasets for both computer vision and natural language processing\ntasks. The results show the effectiveness and generalizability of our\nframework. We also discuss how to adapt SafeCompress to other attacks besides\nmembership inference attack, demonstrating the flexibility of SafeCompress.",

The Central Limit Theorem, which\nunderlies this effect, also allows us to correct it by standardizing citation\naverages for scale {\\it and} subject in a geometrically intuitive manner\nanalogous to calculating the $z$-score. We thus propose the $\\Phi$ index, a\nstandardized scale- and subject-independent citation average. The $\\Phi$ index\npasses the ``random sample test'', a simple check for scale and subject\nindependence that we argue ought to be used for every citation indicator. We\npresent $\\Phi$ index rankings for 12,173 journals using 2020 Journal Citation\nReports data. We show how scale standardization alone affects rankings,\ndemonstrate the additional effect of subject standardization for\nmonodisciplinary journals, and discuss how to treat multidisciplinary journals.\n$\\Phi$ index rankings offer a clear improvement over IF rankings. And because\nthe $\\Phi$ index methodology is general, it can also be applied to compare\nindividual researchers, universities, or countries.",

Such a medium, when probed with\nmonochromatic light beams at frequency $\\omega$, generates additional waves at\nfrequency $2\\omega$. The response of the medium is governed by a system of two\ncoupled semilinear partial differential equations for the electric fields at\nfrequency $\\omega$ and $2\\omega$. We investigate whether there are situations\nin which the generated $2\\omega$ wave is localized inside $D$, that is, the\nnonlinear interaction of the medium with the probing wave is invisible to an\noutside observer. This leads to the analysis of a semilinear elliptic system\nformulated in $D$ with non-standard boundary conditions. The analysis presented\nhere sets up a mathematical framework needed to investigate a multitude of\nquestions related to nonlinear scattering with second-harmonic generation.",

In this paper, we propose an effective state preparation algorithm\nusing an exact CNOT synthesis formulation.

                "summary": "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) with incremental training is crucial in\nindustrial manufacturing, as unpredictable defects make obtaining sufficient\nlabeled data infeasible. However, continual learning methods primarily rely on\nsupervised annotations, while the application in UAD is limited due to the\nabsence of supervision. Current UAD methods train separate models for different\nclasses sequentially, leading to catastrophic forgetting and a heavy\ncomputational burden. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Unsupervised\nContinual Anomaly Detection framework called UCAD, which equips the UAD with\ncontinual learning capability through contrastively-learned prompts. In the\nproposed UCAD, we design a Continual Prompting Module (CPM) by utilizing a\nconcise key-prompt-knowledge memory bank to guide task-invariant `anomaly'\nmodel predictions using task-specific `normal' knowledge. Moreover,\nStructure-based Contrastive Learning (SCL) is designed with the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) to improve prompt learning and anomaly segmentation\nresults. Specifically, by treating SAM's masks as structure, we draw features\nwithin the same mask closer and push others apart for general feature\nrepresentations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and set the benchmark on\nunsupervised continual anomaly detection and segmentation, demonstrating that\nour method is significantly better than anomaly detection methods, even with\nrehearsal training. The code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/shirowalker/UCAD.",

                "summary": "Programming problems can be solved in a multitude of functionally correct\nways, but the quality of these solutions (e.g. readability, maintainability)\ncan vary immensely. When code quality is poor, symptoms emerge in the form of\n'code smells', which are specific negative characteristics (e.g. duplicate\ncode) that can be resolved by applying refactoring patterns. Many undergraduate\ncomputing curricula train students on this software engineering practice, often\ndoing so via exercises on unfamiliar instructor-provided code. Our observation,\nhowever, is that this makes it harder for novices to internalise refactoring as\npart of their own development practices. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach to teaching refactoring, in which students must first complete a\nprogramming exercise constrained to ensure they will produce a code smell. This\nsimple intervention is based on the idea that learning refactoring is easier if\nstudents are familiar with the code (having built it), that it brings\nrefactoring closer to their regular development practice, and that it presents\na powerful opportunity to learn from a 'mistake'. We designed and conducted a\nstudy with 35 novice undergraduates in which they completed various refactoring\nexercises alternately taught using a traditional and our 'mistake-based'\napproach, finding that students were significantly more effective and confident\nat completing exercises using the latter.",

We accomplish this by employing a suitable\nnormalization technique on the original sample covariance matrix. Following\nthis, we establish a harmonic central limit theorem for linear spectral\nstatistics within this expansive framework. This achievement effectively\neliminates the necessity for a bounded spectral norm on the population\ncovariance matrix and relaxes constraints on the rates of dimension $p$ and\nsample size $n$, thereby significantly broadening the applicability of these\nresults in the field of high-dimensional statistics. We illustrate the power of\nthe established results by considering the test for covariance structure under\nhigh dimensionality, freeing both $p$ and $n$.",

This kind of quantifications, termed $k$-GM\nconcurrence, can unambiguously classify entangled states into $(n-1)$ distinct\nclasses from the perspective of $k$-nonseparability with $k$ running from $n$\ndown to 2, and comply with the axiomatic conditions of an entanglement measure.\nCompared to $k$-ME concurrence\n[\\href{https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.062323} {Phys.\nRev. A \\textbf{86}, 062323 (2012)}], the hierarchical measures proposed by us\nembody advantages in distinguishing same class entangled state and measuring\ncontinuity. In addition, we establish the relation between $k$-ME concurrence\nand $k$-GM concurrence, and further derive a strong lower bound on the $k$-GM\nconcurrence by exploiting the permutationally invariant part of a quantum\nstate. Furthermore, we parametrize $k$-GM concurrence to obtain two more\ngeneral and complete categories of quantifications, $q$-$k$-GM concurrence\n$(q>1)$ and $\\alpha$-$k$-GM concurrence $(0\\leq\\alpha<1)$, which obey the\nproperties enjoyed by $k$-GM concurrence as well. In particular,\n$\\alpha$-$2$-GM concurrence $(0<\\alpha<1)$ determines that the GHZ state and\nthe $W$ state belong to the same hierarchy, and it is proven in detail\nsatisfying the requirement that the GHZ state is more entangled than the $W$\nstate in multiqubit systems.",

                "summary": "Personalized PageRank (PPR) is an extensively studied and applied node\nproximity measure in graphs. For a pair of nodes $s$ and $t$ on a graph\n$G=(V,E)$, the PPR value $\\pi(s,t)$ is defined as the probability that an\n$\\alpha$-discounted random walk from $s$ terminates at $t$, where the walk\nterminates with probability $\\alpha$ at each step. We study the classic\nSingle-Source PPR query, which asks for PPR approximations from a given source\nnode $s$ to all nodes in the graph. Specifically, we aim to provide\napproximations with absolute error guarantees, ensuring that the resultant PPR\nestimates $\\hat{\\pi}(s,t)$ satisfy $\\max_{t\\in\nV}\\big|\\hat{\\pi}(s,t)-\\pi(s,t)\\big|\\le\\varepsilon$ for a given error bound\n$\\varepsilon$. We propose an algorithm that achieves this with high\nprobability, with an expected running time of\n  - $\\widetilde{O}\\big(\\sqrt{m}/\\varepsilon\\big)$ for directed graphs, where\n$m=|E|$;\n  - $\\widetilde{O}\\big(\\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{max}}}/\\varepsilon\\big)$ for undirected\ngraphs, where $d_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum node degree in the graph;\n  - $\\widetilde{O}\\left(n^{\\gamma-1/2}/\\varepsilon\\right)$ for power-law\ngraphs, where $n=|V|$ and $\\gamma\\in\\left(\\frac{1}{2},1\\right)$ is the extent\nof the power law.\n  These sublinear bounds improve upon existing results. We also study the case\nwhen degree-normalized absolute error guarantees are desired, requiring\n$\\max_{t\\in V}\\big|\\hat{\\pi}(s,t)/d(t)-\\pi(s,t)/d(t)\\big|\\le\\varepsilon_d$ for\na given error bound $\\varepsilon_d$, where the graph is undirected and $d(t)$\nis the degree of node $t$. We give an algorithm that provides this error\nguarantee with high probability, achieving an expected complexity of\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\sum_{t\\in\nV}\\pi(s,t)/d(t)}\\big/\\varepsilon_d\\right)$.

Enabling coherent electrical manipulation of\nlong-lived mechanical resonators would be instrumental in advancing the\ndevelopment of phononic memories, repeaters, and transducers for microwave\nquantum states. In this study, we demonstrate the compatibility of high-stress\nand crystalline (3C-phase) silicon-carbide membranes with superconducting\nmicrowave circuits. We establish a coherent electromechanical interface for\nlong-lived phonons, allowing precise control over the electromechanical\ncooperativity. This interface enables tunable slow-light time with group delays\nextending up to an impressive duration of \\emph{an hour}. We then investigate a\nphononic memory based on the high-$Q$ ($10^{8}$) silicon-carbide membrane,\ncapable of storing and retrieving microwave coherent states \\emph{on-demand}.\nThe thermal and coherent components can be distinguished through state\ntomography in quadrature phase space, which shows an exponential increase and\ndecay trend respectively as the storage time increases. The electromechanical\ninterface and phononic memory made from crystalline silicon-carbide membrane\npossess enticing attributes, including low microwave-induced mechanical\nheating, phase coherence, an energy decay time of $T_{1}=19.9$~s, and it\nacquires less than one quantum noise within $\\tau_{\\textrm{coh}}=41.3$~ms\nstorage period.

                "summary": "Suicide is recognized as one of the most serious concerns in the modern\nsociety. Suicide causes tragedy that affects countries, communities, and\nfamilies. There are many factors that lead to suicidal ideations. Early\ndetection of suicidal ideations can help to prevent suicide occurrence by\nproviding the victim with the required professional support, especially when\nthe victim does not recognize the danger of having suicidal ideations. As\ntechnology usage has increased, people share and express their ideations\ndigitally via social media, chatbots, and other digital platforms. In this\npaper, we proposed a novel, simple deep learning-based model to detect suicidal\nideations in digital content, mainly focusing on chatbots as the primary data\nsource. In addition, we provide a framework that employs the proposed suicide\ndetection integration with a chatbot-based support system.",

We develop a composition method to\nunearth neat noncommutative analogs of chromatic symmetric functions. A\nsymmetric function is $e$-positive if and only if it has a $\\Lambda$-positive\nnoncommutative analog. We bring to light short and sweet $\\Lambda$-positive\nnoncommutative analogs for the chromatic symmetric functions of tadpoles and\nbarbells. Using these elegant formulas and the composition method, we discover\na new family of $e$-positive graphs and call it hat graphs, which are the\nunicyclic graphs obtained by adding an edge to a path. We also obtain a compact\nribbon Schur analog for cycles.",

We present the mean SFHs of 148 dwarf lenticular\ngalaxies (dS0s) derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. These\nSFHs reveal two distinct periods of active star formation. The first period,\nconcluding approximately 6 Gyr ago, witnessed the formation of predominantly\nold, metal-poor (Z=0.0004) stars, accounting for approximately 60\\% of the\nstellar mass and 30\\% of the luminosity. The scarcity of extremely metal-poor\n(Z=0.0001) stars suggests pre-enrichment during the re-ionization era. Star\nformation gradually waned during this initial phase. In contrast, the second\nperiod, ending around 1 Gyr ago, exhibited a peak in the middle of the period,\ncontributing to the formation of moderately old stellar populations with\nintermediate metallicity. The SFHs of dS0 galaxies show a clear dependence on\nstellar mass, with more massive dS0s forming stars earlier. But, we find no\nsignificant correlation with morphological properties such as outer spiral arms\nand nucleation. The SFHs of dS0 galaxies share many similarities with those of\ndE galaxies, suggesting a common origin, mostly not primordial.",

The phase diagram consists of the ferromagnetic phases, the\nparamagnetic phases, and the phase with weak magnetization (WM). By examining\nthe nearest-neighbor transverse spin correlation, we probe that in the WM\nphase, the spins within a supercell generate a cluster with a small total spin,\nbut between the nearest-neighbor supercells are distributed randomly.\nEspecially for the dimerized limit case, the spins within a supercell tend to\npoint to opposite directions of the transverse field. In addition, we also\ninvestigate the influence of the three-site interaction, and find that the WM\nphase is absent as the strength of the three-site interaction increases. Our\nfindings shed light on the complex behavior of the alternating XY chain and\nprovide valuable insights for future studies.",

We develop an online UDA algorithm for\nsemantic segmentation of images that improves model generalization on\nunannotated domains in scenarios where source data access is restricted during\nadaptation. We perform model adaptation is by minimizing the distributional\ndistance between the source latent features and the target features in a shared\nembedding space. Our solution promotes a shared domain-agnostic latent feature\nspace between the two domains, which allows for classifier generalization on\nthe target dataset. To alleviate the need of access to source samples during\nadaptation, we approximate the source latent feature distribution via an\nappropriate surrogate distribution, in this case a Gassian mixture model (GMM).\nWe evaluate our approach on well established semantic segmentation datasets and\ndemonstrate it compares favorably against state-of-the-art (SOTA) UDA semantic\nsegmentation methods.",

                "summary": "The correctness of a compiler affects the correctness of every program\nwritten in the language, and thus must be thoroughly evaluated. Existing\nautomatic compiler testing methods however either rely on weak oracles (e.g., a\nprogram behaves the same if only dead code is modified), or require substantial\ninitial effort (e.g., having a complete operational language semantics). While\nthe former prevents a comprehensive correctness evaluation, the latter makes\nthose methods irrelevant in practice. In this work, we propose an axiomatic\nsemantics based approach for testing compilers, called PTE. The idea is to\nincrementally develop a set of ``axioms'' capturing anecdotes of the language\nsemantics in the form of \\emph{(\\textbf{p}recondition, \\textbf{t}ransformation,\n\\textbf{e}xpectation) triples, which allows us to test the compiler\nautomatically.} Such axioms are written in the same language whose compiler is\nunder test, and can be developed either based on the language specification, or\nby generalizing the bug reports. PTE has been applied to a newly developed\ncompiler (i.e., Cangjie) and a mature compiler (i.e., Java), and successfully\nidentified 42 implementation bugs and 9 potential language design issues.",

                "summary": "Event-based cameras provide accurate and high temporal resolution\nmeasurements for performing computer vision tasks in challenging scenarios,\nsuch as high-dynamic range environments and fast-motion maneuvers. Despite\ntheir advantages, utilizing deep learning for event-based vision encounters a\nsignificant obstacle due to the scarcity of annotated data caused by the\nrelatively recent emergence of event-based cameras. To overcome this\nlimitation, leveraging the knowledge available from annotated data obtained\nwith conventional frame-based cameras presents an effective solution based on\nunsupervised domain adaptation. We propose a new algorithm tailored for\nadapting a deep neural network trained on annotated frame-based data to\ngeneralize well on event-based unannotated data. Our approach incorporates\nuncorrelated conditioning and self-supervised learning in an adversarial\nlearning scheme to close the gap between the two source and target domains. By\napplying self-supervised learning, the algorithm learns to align the\nrepresentations of event-based data with those from frame-based camera data,\nthereby facilitating knowledge transfer.Furthermore, the inclusion of\nuncorrelated conditioning ensures that the adapted model effectively\ndistinguishes between event-based and conventional data, enhancing its ability\nto classify event-based images accurately.Through empirical experimentation and\nevaluation, we demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses existing approaches\ndesigned for the same purpose using two benchmarks. The superior performance of\nour solution is attributed to its ability to effectively utilize annotated data\nfrom frame-based cameras and transfer the acquired knowledge to the event-based\nvision domain.",

                "summary": "It has been an unanswered question how many dusty galaxies have been\nundetected from the state-of-the-art observational surveys. JWST enables us to\ndetect faint IR galaxies that have prominent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon\n(PAH) features in the mid-IR wavelengths. PAH is a valuable tracer of star\nformation and dust properties in the mid-infrared wavelength. The JWST Cosmic\nEvolution Early Release Science (CEERS) fields provide us with wavelength\ncoverage from 7.7 to 21 $\\mu$m using six photometric bands of the mid-infrared\ninstrument (MIRI). We have identified galaxies dominated by mid-IR emission\nfrom PAHs, termed PAH galaxies. From our multi-band photometry catalogue, we\nselected ten PAH galaxies displaying high flux ratios of $\\log(S_{15}/S_{10}) >\n0.8$. The SED fitting analysis indicates that these galaxies are star-forming\ngalaxies with total IR luminosities of $10^{10}$ $\\sim$ $10^{11.5}$ $L_{\\odot}$\nat z $\\sim 1$. The morphology of PAH galaxies does not show any clear\nsignatures of major merging or interaction within the MIRI resolution. The\nmajority of them are on the star-formation main sequence at $z \\sim 1$. Our\nresult demonstrates that JWST can detect PAH emissions from normal star-forming\ngalaxies at $z \\sim 1$, in addition to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies\n(ULIRGs) or luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs).",

                "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) have\nsignificantly propelled the field of AIGC. Text-to-Audio (TTA), a burgeoning\nAIGC application designed to generate audio from natural language prompts, is\nattracting increasing attention. However, existing TTA studies often struggle\nwith generation quality and text-audio alignment, especially for complex\ntextual inputs. Drawing inspiration from state-of-the-art Text-to-Image (T2I)\ndiffusion models, we introduce Auffusion, a TTA system adapting T2I model\nframeworks to TTA task, by effectively leveraging their inherent generative\nstrengths and precise cross-modal alignment. Our objective and subjective\nevaluations demonstrate that Auffusion surpasses previous TTA approaches using\nlimited data and computational resource. Furthermore, previous studies in T2I\nrecognizes the significant impact of encoder choice on cross-modal alignment,\nlike fine-grained details and object bindings, while similar evaluation is\nlacking in prior TTA works. Through comprehensive ablation studies and\ninnovative cross-attention map visualizations, we provide insightful\nassessments of text-audio alignment in TTA. Our findings reveal Auffusion's\nsuperior capability in generating audios that accurately match textual\ndescriptions, which further demonstrated in several related tasks, such as\naudio style transfer, inpainting and other manipulations.

                "summary": "In the stratified or partially premixed piloted jet flames, previous\nexperimental and priori studies have identified a strong correlation between\nmixture fraction and progress variable. In the framework of large-eddy\nsimulation (LES) and flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) approach, a joint\nprobability density function (PDF) method is constructed to characterize\nsubgrid correlations. To pave the way for high dimensional tabulation modeling,\na deep residual network (ResNet) is trained, dramatically reducing the memory\nfootprint of tabulation. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) shared memory\ntechnique is applied to load the original chemical table during parallel\ncomputations. Application of LES to a partially pre-vaporized ethanol spray\nflame demonstrates good agreement with experimental results. Consideration of\nthe subgrid correlation results in a noticeable improvement in temperature\nprediction. Calculations using ResNet show a notable consistency with those\nusing chemical tables. Visualization of enthalpy highlights the significance of\nnon-adiabatic tabulation in modeling liquid fuel combustion. The unscaled\nprogress variable is selected to better describe the chemical reaction rate in\nthe blending zone of an air stream and a pilot stream with the product of a\nfully burnt lean fuel mixture. The impact of the source term due to evaporation\nin the transport equation of the progress variable is validated. The\ncorrelation coefficient is found to significantly influence the chemical\nreaction rate. The subgrid-scale interaction between liquid fuel evaporation\nand subgrid correlation is elucidated.",

Previous work studying the\nproperties of tensor power iteration is either limited to a constant number of\niterations, or requires a non-trivial data-independent initialization. In this\npaper, we move beyond these limitations and analyze the dynamics of randomly\ninitialized tensor power iteration up to polynomially many steps. Our\ncontributions are threefold: First, we establish sharp bounds on the number of\niterations required for power method to converge to the planted signal, for a\nbroad range of the signal-to-noise ratios. Second, our analysis reveals that\nthe actual algorithmic threshold for power iteration is smaller than the one\nconjectured in literature by a polylog(n) factor, where n is the ambient\ndimension. Finally, we propose a simple and effective stopping criterion for\npower iteration, which provably outputs a solution that is highly correlated\nwith the true signal. Extensive numerical experiments verify our theoretical\nresults.",

The incorporation of multiple views in the domain\nadaptation was paid little attention in the previous studies. In this way, we\npropose an analysis of generalization bounds with Pac-Bayesian theory to\nconsolidate the two paradigms, which are currently treated separately. Firstly,\nbuilding on previous work by Germain et al., we adapt the distance between\ndistribution proposed by Germain et al. for domain adaptation with the concept\nof multi-view learning. Thus, we introduce a novel distance that is tailored\nfor the multi-view domain adaptation setting. Then, we give Pac-Bayesian bounds\nfor estimating the introduced divergence.

It is assumed that the Maxwell systems are\nequipped with suitable m-dissipative boundary conditions, namely, with\nLeontovich or generalized impedance boundary conditions of the form $n \\times E\n= Z [(n \\times H )\\times n ] $. We show that, for a wide class of impedance\noperators $Z$, the nonzero spectrum of the corresponding Maxwell operator is\ndiscrete. To this end, a new continuous embedding theorem for domains of\nMaxwell operators is obtained. We prove the convergence of eigenvalues to an\neigenvalue of a homogenized Maxwell operator under the assumption of the\nH-convergence of the material tensor-fields. This result is used then to prove\nthe existence of optimizers for eigenvalue optimization problems and the\nexistence of an eigenvalue-free region around zero.

                "summary": "In situ measurement of analytes for in vivo or in vitro systems has been\nchallenging due to the bulky size of traditional analytical instruments. Also,\nfrequent in vitro concentration measurements rely on fluorescence-based methods\nor direct slicing of the matrix for analyses. These traditional approaches\nbecome unreliable if localized and in situ analyses are needed. In contrast,\nfor in situ and real-time analysis of target analytes, surface-engineered\noptical fibers can be leveraged as a powerful miniaturized tool, which has\nshown promise from bio to environmental studies. Herein, we demonstrate an\noptical fiber functionalized with gold nanoparticles using a dip-coating\nprocess to investigate the interaction of light with molecules at or near the\nsurface of the optical fiber. Localized surface plasmon resonance from the\nlight-matter interaction enables the detection of minute changes in the\nrefractive index of the surrounding medium. We used this principle to assess\nthe in situ molecular distribution of a synthetic drug (methylene blue) in an\nin vitro matrix (agarose gel) having varying concentrations. Leveraging the\nprobed Z-height in diffused analytes, combined with its in silico data, our\nplatform shows the feasibility of a simple optofluidic tool. Such\nstraightforward in situ measurements of analytes with optical fiber hold\npotential for real-time molecular diffusion and molecular perturbation analyses\nrelevant to biomedical and clinical studies.",

These qubits are\nprotected by particle-hole symmetry even for $K_{z}\\neq 0$. Braiding of these\nMajorana fermions is possible by temporally controlling a spin-correlation\nHamiltonian. In addition, the fusion is possible by measuring the spin\ncorrelation. By switching on the Heisenberg interaction together with magnetic\nfield, only one zero-energy state persists, which can be used as an\ninitialization of qubits. Furthermore, it is shown that $3L+2$ qubits are\nconstructed on the Kitaev spin liquid model on connected $L$ hexagons. All the\nprocesses of initialization, operation and readout of qubits are executable in\nterms of spin operators.",

                "summary": "The goal of Continual Learning (CL) is to continuously learn from new data\nstreams and accomplish the corresponding tasks. Previously studied CL assumes\nthat data are given in sequence nose-to-tail for different tasks, thus indeed\nbelonging to Serial Continual Learning (SCL). This paper studies the novel\nparadigm of Parallel Continual Learning (PCL) in dynamic multi-task scenarios,\nwhere a diverse set of tasks is encountered at different time points. PCL\npresents challenges due to the training of an unspecified number of tasks with\nvarying learning progress, leading to the difficulty of guaranteeing effective\nmodel updates for all encountered tasks. In our previous conference work, we\nfocused on measuring and reducing the discrepancy among gradients in a\nmulti-objective optimization problem, which, however, may still contain\nnegative transfers in every model update. To address this issue, in the dynamic\nmulti-objective optimization problem, we introduce task-specific elastic\nfactors to adjust the descent direction towards the Pareto front. The proposed\nmethod, called Elastic Multi-Gradient Descent (EMGD), ensures that each update\nfollows an appropriate Pareto descent direction, minimizing any negative impact\non previously learned tasks. To balance the training between old and new tasks,\nwe also propose a memory editing mechanism guided by the gradient computed\nusing EMGD. This editing process updates the stored data points, reducing\ninterference in the Pareto descent direction from previous tasks. Experiments\non public datasets validate the effectiveness of our EMGD in the PCL setting.",

                "summary": "In recent times, substantial advancements have been witnessed in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, showcasing remarkable\nproficiency across a range of complex tasks. However, many mainstream LLMs\n(e.g. LLaMA) are pretrained on English-dominant corpus, which limits their\nperformance in other non-English languages. In this paper, we focus on how to\neffectively transfer the capabilities of language generation and following\ninstructions to a non-English language. To answer this question, we conduct an\nextensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU\nhours. We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension,\nfurther pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer. To accurately assess\nthe model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing\nbenchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench. Furthermore, a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted,\nconsidering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical\ncoherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting\ninstruction tasks from 17 diverse categories. Our evaluation results\ndemonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can\nbe achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of\nknowledge alignment and response quality. Furthermore, the experimental\noutcomes across the thirteen low-resource languages also exhibit similar\ntrends. We anticipate that the conclusions revealed by the experiments will aid\nthe community in developing non-English LLMs.",

                "summary": "Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) plays a crucial role in wireless\ncommunication systems. Deep learning AMR strategies have achieved tremendous\nsuccess in recent years. Modulated signals exhibit long temporal dependencies,\nand extracting global features is crucial in identifying modulation schemes.\nTraditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to\nclassify modulation schemes. Classical convolutional-based networks, due to\ntheir limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle\nto capture global relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce a\nnovel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures\nof the transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM). We utilize the\nself-attention mechanism of the transformer to model the global correlations in\nsignal sequences while employing LSTM to enhance the capture of temporal\ndependencies. To mitigate the impact like RF fingerprint features and channel\ncharacteristics on model generalization, we propose data augmentation\nstrategies known as segment substitution (SS) to enhance the model's robustness\nto modulation-related features. Experimental results on widely-used datasets\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits\nsignificant advantages in terms of complexity. Our proposed framework serves as\na foundational backbone that can be extended to different datasets. We have\nverified the effectiveness of our augmentation approach in enhancing the\ngeneralization of the models, particularly in few-shot scenarios.

Recognizing\nthe utility of pharmacophores in facilitating scaffold hopping, we developed\nTransPharmer, an innovative generative model that integrates ligand-based\ninterpretable pharmacophore fingerprints with generative pre-training\ntransformer (GPT) for de novo molecule generation. TransPharmer demonstrates\nsuperior performance across tasks involving unconditioned distribution\nlearning, de novo generation and scaffold elaboration under pharmacophoric\nconstraints. Its distinct exploration mode within the local chemical space\nrenders it particularly useful for scaffold hopping, producing compounds that\nare structurally novel while pharmaceutically related. The efficacy of\nTransPharmer is validated through two case studies involving the dopamine\nreceptor D2 (DRD2) and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Notably in the case of PLK1,\nthree out of four synthesized designed compounds exhibit submicromolar\nactivities, with the most potent one, IIP0943, demonstrating a potency of 5.1\nnM. Featuring a new scaffold of 4-(benzo[b]thiophen-7-yloxy)pyrimidine, IIP0943\nalso exhibits high selectivity for PLK1. It was demonstrated that TransPharmer\nis a powerful tool for discovery of novel and bioactive ligands.",

                "summary": "Pre-trained code models have recently achieved substantial improvements in\nmany code intelligence tasks. These models are first pre-trained on large-scale\nunlabeled datasets in a task-agnostic manner using self-supervised learning,\nand then fine-tuned on labeled datasets in downstream tasks. However, the\nlabeled datasets are usually limited in size (i.e., human intensive efforts),\nwhich may hinder the performance of pre-trained code models in specific tasks.\nTo mitigate this, one possible solution is to leverage the large-scale\nunlabeled data in the tuning stage by pseudo-labeling. However, directly\nemploying the pseudo-labeled data can bring a large amount of noise, i.e.,\nincorrect labels, leading to suboptimal performance. How to effectively\nleverage the noisy pseudo-labeled data is a challenging yet under-explored\nproblem.In this paper, we propose a novel approach named HINT to improve\npre-trained code models with large-scale unlabeled datasets by better utilizing\nthe pseudo-labeled data. HINT includes two main modules: HybrId pseudo-labeled\ndata selection and Noise-tolerant Training. In the hybrid pseudo-data selection\nmodule, considering the robustness issue, apart from directly measuring the\nquality of pseudo labels through training loss, we further propose to employ a\nretrieval-based method to filter low-quality pseudo-labeled data. The\nnoise-tolerant training module aims to further mitigate the influence of errors\nin pseudo labels by training the model with a noise-tolerant loss function and\nby regularizing the consistency of model predictions.The experimental results\nshow that HINT can better leverage those unlabeled data in a task-specific way\nand provide complementary benefits for pre-trained models, e.g., improving the\nbest baseline model by 15.33%, 16.50%, and 8.98% on code summarization, defect\ndetection, and assertion generation, respectively.",

                "summary": "We propose a robust hypothesis testing procedure for the predictability of\nmultiple predictors that could be highly persistent. Our method improves the\npopular extended instrumental variable (IVX) testing (Phillips and Lee, 2013;\nKostakis et al., 2015) in that, besides addressing the two bias effects found\nin Hosseinkouchack and Demetrescu (2021), we find and deal with the\nvariance-enlargement effect. We show that two types of higher-order terms\ninduce these distortion effects in the test statistic, leading to significant\nover-rejection for one-sided tests and tests in multiple predictive\nregressions. Our improved IVX-based test includes three steps to tackle all the\nissues above regarding finite sample bias and variance terms. Thus, the test\nstatistics perform well in size control, while its power performance is\ncomparable with the original IVX. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical\nstudy on the predictability of bond risk premia are provided to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the newly proposed approach.",

                "summary": "The rapid development of the autonomous driving industry has led to a\nsignificant accumulation of autonomous driving data. Consequently, there comes\na growing demand for retrieving data to provide specialized optimization.\nHowever, directly applying previous image retrieval methods faces several\nchallenges, such as the lack of global feature representation and inadequate\ntext retrieval ability for complex driving scenes. To address these issues,\nfirstly, we propose the BEV-TSR framework which leverages descriptive text as\nan input to retrieve corresponding scenes in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.\nThen to facilitate complex scene retrieval with extensive text descriptions, we\nemploy a large language model (LLM) to extract the semantic features of the\ntext inputs and incorporate knowledge graph embeddings to enhance the semantic\nrichness of the language embedding. To achieve feature alignment between the\nBEV feature and language embedding, we propose Shared Cross-modal Embedding\nwith a set of shared learnable embeddings to bridge the gap between these two\nmodalities, and employ a caption generation task to further enhance the\nalignment. Furthermore, there lack of well-formed retrieval datasets for\neffective evaluation. To this end, we establish a multi-level retrieval\ndataset, nuScenes-Retrieval, based on the widely adopted nuScenes dataset.\nExperimental results on the multi-level nuScenes-Retrieval show that BEV-TSR\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., 85.78% and 87.66% top-1 accuracy\non scene-to-text and text-to-scene retrieval respectively.

                "summary": "Due to the poor illumination and the difficulty in annotating, nighttime\nconditions pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicle perception\nsystems. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely applied to\nsemantic segmentation on such images to adapt models from normal conditions to\ntarget nighttime-condition domains. Self-training (ST) is a paradigm in UDA,\nwhere a momentum teacher is utilized for pseudo-label prediction, but a\nconfirmation bias issue exists. Because the one-directional knowledge transfer\nfrom a single teacher is insufficient to adapt to a large domain shift. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose to alleviate domain gap by incrementally\nconsidering style influence and illumination change. Therefore, we introduce a\none-stage Dual-Teacher Bi-directional Self-training (DTBS) framework for smooth\nknowledge transfer and feedback. Based on two teacher models, we present a\nnovel pipeline to respectively decouple style and illumination shift. In\naddition, we propose a new Re-weight exponential moving average (EMA) to merge\nthe knowledge of style and illumination factors, and provide feedback to the\nstudent model. In this way, our method can be embedded in other UDA methods to\nenhance their performance. For example, the Cityscapes to ACDC night task\nyielded 53.8 mIoU (\\%), which corresponds to an improvement of +5\\% over the\nprevious state-of-the-art.

The high-$n$\nmodes in non-axisymmetric VDE grow first, which drive the formation of high-$n$\nmagnetic island chains. Subsequently, the magnetic island chains grow and\noverlap with each other, leading to the destruction of the magnetic flux\nsurface, which induces a minor disruption and accelerates the start of the\nfollowing major disruption. The magnetic island and the stochastic magnetic\nfield allow the toroidally asymmetric poloidal plasma current to jet towards\nthe hoop force direction, forming the finger and filamentary structures.

                "summary": "In this paper, we propose an iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM)\nbased on prediction-correction for solving the topology optimization problem in\nsteady-state heat transfer equations. The problem is formulated as a\nconstrained minimization problem of the complementary energy, incorporating a\nperimeter/surface-area regularization term, while satisfying a steady-state\nheat transfer equation. The decision variables of the optimization problem\nrepresent the domains of different materials and are represented by indicator\nfunctions. The perimeter/surface-area term of the domain is approximated using\nGaussian kernel convolution with indicator functions. In each iteration, the\nindicator function is updated using a prediction-correction approach. The\nprediction step is based on the variation of the objective functional by\nimposing the constraints, while the correction step ensures the monotonically\ndecreasing behavior of the objective functional. Numerical results demonstrate\nthe efficiency and robustness of our proposed method, particularly when\ncompared to classical approaches based on the ICTM.",

                "title": "A Novel Dual-Stage Evolutionary Algorithm for Finding Robust Solutions",
                "summary": "In robust optimization problems, the magnitude of perturbations is relatively\nsmall. Consequently, solutions within certain regions are less likely to\nrepresent the robust optima when perturbations are introduced. Hence, a more\nefficient search process would benefit from increased opportunities to explore\npromising regions where global optima or good local optima are situated. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel robust evolutionary algorithm named the\ndual-stage robust evolutionary algorithm (DREA) aimed at discovering robust\nsolutions. DREA operates in two stages: the peak-detection stage and the robust\nsolution-searching stage. The primary objective of the peak-detection stage is\nto identify peaks in the fitness landscape of the original optimization\nproblem. Conversely, the robust solution-searching stage focuses on swiftly\nidentifying the robust optimal solution using information obtained from the\npeaks discovered in the initial stage. These two stages collectively enable the\nproposed DREA to efficiently obtain the robust optimal solution for the\noptimization problem. This approach achieves a balance between solution\noptimality and robustness by separating the search processes for optimal and\nrobust optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DREA\nsignificantly outperforms five state-of-the-art algorithms across 18 test\nproblems characterized by diverse complexities. Moreover, when evaluated on\nhigher-dimensional robust optimization problems (100-$D$ and 200-$D$), DREA\nalso demonstrates superior performance compared to all five counterpart\nalgorithms.",

Whereas existing tools have struggled to realize\nunit test generation for C++, Coyote C++ is able to produce high coverage\nresults from unit test generation at a testing speed of over 10,000 statements\nper hour. This impressive feat is made possible by the combination of a\npowerful concolic execution engine with sophisticated automated test harness\ngeneration. Additionally, the GUI of Coyote C++ displays detailed code coverage\nvisualizations and provides various configuration features for users seeking to\nmanually optimize their coverage results. Combining potent one-click automated\ntesting with rich support for manual tweaking, Coyote C++ is the first\nautomated testing tool that is practical enough to make automated testing of\nC++ code truly viable in industrial applications.",

Many existing methods strive to enhance the\nobject depth estimation performance by allocating additional parameters for\nobject depth estimation, utilizing extra modules or data. In contrast, we\nintroduce a novel metric learning scheme that encourages the model to extract\ndepth-discriminative features regardless of the visual attributes without\nincreasing inference time and model size. Our method employs the\ndistance-preserving function to organize the feature space manifold in relation\nto ground-truth object depth. The proposed (K, B, eps)-quasi-isometric loss\nleverages predetermined pairwise distance restriction as guidance for adjusting\nthe distance among object descriptors without disrupting the non-linearity of\nthe natural feature manifold. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary head for\nobject-wise depth estimation, which enhances depth quality while maintaining\nthe inference time. The broad applicability of our method is demonstrated\nthrough experiments that show improvements in overall performance when\nintegrated into various baselines. The results show that our method\nconsistently improves the performance of various baselines by 23.51% and 5.78%\non average across KITTI and Waymo, respectively.",

                "summary": "Recently, substantial advancements in pre-trained vision-language models have\ngreatly enhanced the capabilities of multi-modal dialog systems. These models\nhave demonstrated significant improvements by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.\nHowever, the existing pre-trained models primarily focus on effectively\ncapturing the alignment between vision and language modalities, often ignoring\nthe intricate nature of dialog context. In this paper, we propose a\nparameter-efficient prompt-tuning method named DialCLIP for multi-modal dialog\nretrieval. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-modal context prompt\ngenerator to learn context features which are subsequently distilled into\nprompts within the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP. Besides, we\nintroduce domain prompt to mitigate the disc repancy from the downstream dialog\ndata. To facilitate various types of retrieval, we also design multiple experts\nto learn mappings from CLIP outputs to multi-modal representation space, with\neach expert being responsible to one specific retrieval type. Extensive\nexperiments show that DialCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two\nwidely recognized benchmark datasets (i.e., PhotoChat and MMDialog) by tuning a\nmere 0.04% of the total parameters. These results highlight the efficacy and\nefficiency of our proposed approach, underscoring its potential to advance the\nfield of multi-modal dialog retrieval.",

Particularly,\nheat transfer critically affects fluid behavior within the eye and ocular drug\ndelivery processes. Overcoming the challenges of experimental analysis, this\nstudy introduces a comprehensive three-dimensional mathematical and\ncomputational model to simulate the heat transfer in a realistic geometry. Our\nwork includes an extensive sensitivity analysis to address uncertainties and\ndelineate the impact of different variables on heat distribution in ocular\ntissues. To manage the model's complexity, we employed a very fast model\nreduction technique with certified sharp error bounds, ensuring computational\nefficiency without compromising accuracy. Our results demonstrate remarkable\nconsistency with experimental observations and align closely with existing\nnumerical findings in the literature. Crucially, our findings underscore the\nsignificant role of blood flowand environmental conditions, particularly in the\neye's internal tissues. Clinically, this model offers a promising tool for\nexamining the temperature-related effects of various therapeutic interventions\non the eye. Such insights are invaluable for optimizing treatment strategies in\nophthalmology.",

This study traces\nhistorical and projected changes in global food systems toward alignment with\nthe new Healthy Diet Basket (HDB) used by UN agencies and the World Bank to\nmonitor the cost and affordability of healthy diets worldwide. Using the HDB as\na standard to measure adequacy of national, regional and global supply-demand\nbalances, we find substantial but inconsistent progress toward closer alignment\nwith dietary guidelines, with large global shortfalls in fruits, vegetables,\nand legumes, nuts, and seeds, and large disparities among regions in use of\nanimal source foods. Projections show that additional investments aimed at\nreducing chronic hunger would modestly accelerate improvements in adequacy\nwhere shortfalls are greatest, revealing the need for complementary investments\nto increase access to under-consumed food groups especially in low-income\ncountries.",

                "summary": "Visual-inertial SLAM is crucial in various fields, such as aerial vehicles,\nindustrial robots, and autonomous driving. The fusion of camera and inertial\nmeasurement unit (IMU) makes up for the shortcomings of a signal sensor, which\nsignificantly improves the accuracy and robustness of localization in\nchallenging environments. This article presents PLE-SLAM, an accurate and\nreal-time visual-inertial SLAM algorithm based on point-line features and\nefficient IMU initialization. First, we use parallel computing methods to\nextract features and compute descriptors to ensure real-time performance.\nAdjacent short line segments are merged into long line segments, and isolated\nshort line segments are directly deleted. Second, a\nrotation-translation-decoupled initialization method is extended to use both\npoints and lines. Gyroscope bias is optimized by tightly coupling IMU\nmeasurements and image observations. Accelerometer bias and gravity direction\nare solved by an analytical method for efficiency. To improve the system's\nintelligence in handling complex environments, a scheme of leveraging semantic\ninformation and geometric constraints to eliminate dynamic features and A\nsolution for loop detection and closed-loop frame pose estimation using CNN and\nGNN are integrated into the system. All networks are accelerated to ensure\nreal-time performance. The experiment results on public datasets illustrate\nthat PLE-SLAM is one of the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems.",

Specifically, the trajectories of all airborne arrival aircraft\nwithin the temporal capture window are used to generate an image with the\ntarget aircraft trajectory labeled as red and all background aircraft\ntrajectory labeled as blue. The trajectory images contain various information,\nincluding the aircraft position, speed, heading, relative distances, and\narrival traffic flows. It enables us to use state-of-the-art deep convolution\nneural networks for ALT modeling. We also use real-time runway usage obtained\nfrom the trajectory data and the external information such as aircraft types\nand weather conditions as additional inputs. Moreover, a convolution neural\nnetwork (CNN) based module is designed for automatic holding-related\nfeaturizing, which takes the trajectory images, the leading aircraft holding\nstatus, and their time and speed gap at the research airspace boundary as its\ninputs. Its output is further fed into the final end-to-end ALT prediction. The\nproposed ALT prediction approach is applied to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO\nCode: WSSS) using one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)\ndata from November 1 to November 30, 2022. Experimental results show that by\nintegrating the holding featurization, we can reduce the mean absolute error\n(MAE) from 82.23 seconds to 43.96 seconds, and achieve an average accuracy of\n96.1\\%, with 79.4\\% of the predictions errors being less than 60 seconds.",

Inspired by prior work, a new NPG variant\ncoined NPG-HM is developed in this paper, which utilizes the Hessian-aided\nmomentum technique for variance reduction, while the sub-problem is solved via\nthe stochastic gradient descent method. It is shown that NPG-HM can achieve the\nglobal last iterate $\\epsilon$-optimality with a sample complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$, which is the best known result for natural policy\ngradient type methods under the generic Fisher non-degenerate policy\nparameterizations. The convergence analysis is built upon a relaxed weak\ngradient dominance property tailored for NPG under the compatible function\napproximation framework, as well as a neat way to decompose the error when\nhandling the sub-problem. Moreover, numerical experiments on Mujoco-based\nenvironments demonstrate the superior performance of NPG-HM over other\nstate-of-the-art policy gradient methods.",

Demonstrated through\ncontrolling image classifiers, it empowers the adversary to manipulate the\nvictim model with arbitrary output through language-guided instructions. This\nis achieved using a language model to fuel a conditional trigger generator,\nwith optimizations designed to extend its language understanding capabilities\nto backdoor instruction interpretation and execution. Our experiments across\nthree datasets, five attacks, and nine defenses confirm Imperio's\neffectiveness. It can produce contextually adaptive triggers from text\ndescriptions and control the victim model with desired outputs, even in\nscenarios not encountered during training. The attack reaches a high success\nrate across complex datasets without compromising the accuracy of clean inputs\nand exhibits resilience against representative defenses.",

We exhibit a tight H\\\"older-behavior for this operation under minimal\nassumptions. Our proof essentially relies on a new bound that quantifies the\nsize of the singular sets of a convex and Lipschitz continuous function on a\nbounded domain.",

The selected stars have a\nvariety of observational characteristics, with a higher than 80% probability of\nbeing Delta Scuti stars. We have displayed all the stars in the\nHertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram along with the Delta Scuti instability strip,\nthe Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS), and the Terminal-Age Main Sequence (TAMS).\nThen, we determined which fundamental and overtone modes each star belongs to\nusing pulsation constant (Q) calculations. In addition, we evaluated the\nparameters in the Q calculation equation using three machine learning methods,\nwhich showed that surface gravity and temperature have the greatest effect on\nits calculation. The Period-Luminosity (P-L) relationship of the Delta Scuti\nstars was also revisited. Eventually, using least squares linear regression, we\nmade four linear fits for fundamental and overtone modes and updated their\nrelationships.",

Our objective is to maximize the system sum throughput by optimizing\nthe allocation of communication resources. To attain this objective and\nmeanwhile balance the performance-cost tradeoff, we propose three transmission\nschemes: the IRS-aided asynchronous (Asy) scheme, the IRS-aided time-division\nmultiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided synchronous (Syn) scheme. For\nthe resulting three non-convex design problems, we propose a general\nalgorithmic framework capable of suboptimally addressing all of them. Numerical\nresults show that our proposed IRS-aided schemes noticeably surpass their\ncounterparts without IRSs in both system sum throughput and total transmission\nenergy consumption at the HAPs. Moreover, although the IRS-aided Asy scheme\nconsistently achieves the highest sum throughput, the IRS-aided TDMA scheme is\nmore appealing in scenarios with substantial cross-link interference and\nlimited IRS elements, while the IRS-aided Syn scheme is preferable in low\ncross-link interference scenarios.",

                "summary": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to localize pixel points whose\nspectral features differ from the background. HAD is essential in scenarios of\nunknown or camouflaged target features, such as water quality monitoring, crop\ngrowth monitoring and camouflaged target detection, where prior information of\ntargets is difficult to obtain. Existing HAD methods aim to objectively detect\nand distinguish background and anomalous spectra, which can be achieved almost\neffortlessly by human perception. However, the underlying processes of human\nvisual perception are thought to be quite complex. In this paper, we analyze\nhyperspectral image (HSI) features under human visual perception, and transfer\nthe solution process of HAD to the more robust feature space for the first\ntime. Specifically, we propose a small target aware detector (STAD), which\nintroduces saliency maps to capture HSI features closer to human visual\nperception. STAD not only extracts more anomalous representations, but also\nreduces the impact of low-confidence regions through a proposed small target\nfilter (STF). Furthermore, considering the possibility of HAD algorithms being\napplied to edge devices, we propose a full connected network to convolutional\nnetwork knowledge distillation strategy. It can learn the spectral and spatial\nfeatures of the HSI while lightening the network. We train the network on the\nHAD100 training set and validate the proposed method on the HAD100 test set.\nOur method provides a new solution space for HAD that is closer to human visual\nperception with high confidence. Sufficient experiments on real HSI with\nmultiple method comparisons demonstrate the excellent performance and unique\npotential of the proposed method.

                "summary": "Aims. We studied the manifestation of decayless oscillations in 3D\nsimulations of coronal loops, driven by random motions. Methods. Using the\nPLUTO code, we ran magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a straight\ngravitationally stratified flux tube, with its footpoints embedded in\nchromospheric plasma. We consider transverse waves drivers with a horizontally\npolarised red noise power-law spectrum. Results. Our broadband drivers lead to\nthe excitation of standing waves with frequencies equal to the fundamental\nstanding kink mode and its harmonics. These standing kink oscillations have\nnon-decaying amplitudes, and spectra that depend on the characteristics of the\nloops, with the latter amplifying the resonant frequencies from the drivers. We\nthus report for the first time in 3D simulations the manifestation of decayless\noscillations from broadband drivers. The spatial and temporal evolution of our\noscillation spectra reveals the manifestation of a half harmonic, which\nexhibits half the frequency of the identified fundamental mode with a similar\nspatial profile. Our results suggest that this mode is related to the presence\nof the transition region in our model and could be interpreted as being the\nequivalent to the fundamental mode of standing sound waves driven on pipes\nclosed at one end. Conclusions. The potential existence of this half harmonic\nhas important implications for coronal seismology, since misinterpreting it for\nthe fundamental mode of the system can lead to false estimations of the average\nkink speed profile along oscillating loops. Finally, its detection could\npotentially give us a tool for distinguishing between different excitation and\ndriving mechanisms of decayless oscillations in observations.",

Using the aforementioned\nmethod and computational software, we have obtained different kinds of periodic\nand singular solitary wave solutions of the generalized shallow water wave\nequation.

While SoundStorm, a state-of-the-art parallel audio generation\nmodel, accelerates inference speed compared to autoregressive models, it still\nsuffers from slow inference due to iterative sampling. To resolve this problem,\nwe propose Group-Masked Language Modeling~(G-MLM) and Group Iterative Parallel\nDecoding~(G-IPD) for efficient parallel audio generation. Both the training and\nsampling schemes enable the model to synthesize high-quality audio with a small\nnumber of iterations by effectively modeling the group-wise conditional\ndependencies.

By exploiting the manifold\nhypothesis, various techniques for nonlinear dimension reduction have been\ndeveloped to facilitate visualization, classification, clustering, and gaining\nkey insights. Although existing manifold learning methods have achieved\nremarkable successes, they still suffer from extensive distortions incurred in\nthe global structure, which hinders the understanding of underlying patterns.\nScalability issues also limit their applicability for handling large-scale\ndata. Here, we propose a scalable manifold learning (scML) method that can\nmanipulate large-scale and high-dimensional data in an efficient manner. It\nstarts by seeking a set of landmarks to construct the low-dimensional skeleton\nof the entire data, and then incorporates the non-landmarks into the learned\nspace based on the constrained locally linear embedding (CLLE). We empirically\nvalidated the effectiveness of scML on synthetic datasets and real-world\nbenchmarks of different types, and applied it to analyze the single-cell\ntranscriptomics and detect anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. scML\nscales well with increasing data sizes and embedding dimensions, and exhibits\npromising performance in preserving the global structure.

However, an overlooked problem in JCAS,\nand specifically in WLAN Sensing, is the sensitivity of the system to a\ndeceptive jammer, which introduces phantom targets to mislead the victim radar\nreceiver. Standardized waveforms and sensing parameters make the system\nvulnerable to physical layer attacks. Moreover, orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) makes deceptive jamming even easier as it allows digitally\ngenerated artificial range/Doppler maps. This paper studies deceptive jamming\nin JCAS, with a special focus on WLAN Sensing. The provided mathematical models\ngive insights into how to design jamming signals and their impact on the\nsensing system.

                "summary": "Face recognition systems have raised concerns due to their vulnerability to\ndifferent presentation attacks, and system security has become an increasingly\ncritical concern. Although many face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods perform well\nin intra-dataset scenarios, their generalization remains a challenge. To\naddress this issue, some methods adopt domain adversarial training (DAT) to\nextract domain-invariant features. However, the competition between the encoder\nand the domain discriminator can cause the network to be difficult to train and\nconverge. In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial attack (DAA) method to\nmitigate the training instability problem by adding perturbations to the input\nimages, which makes them indistinguishable across domains and enables domain\nalignment. Moreover, since models trained on limited data and types of attacks\ncannot generalize well to unknown attacks, we propose a dual perceptual and\ngenerative knowledge distillation framework for face anti-spoofing that\nutilizes pre-trained face-related models containing rich face priors.\nSpecifically, we adopt two different face-related models as teachers to\ntransfer knowledge to the target student model. The pre-trained teacher models\nare not from the task of face anti-spoofing but from perceptual and generative\ntasks, respectively, which implicitly augment the data. By combining both DAA\nand dual-teacher knowledge distillation, we develop a dual teacher knowledge\ndistillation with domain alignment framework (DTDA) for face anti-spoofing. The\nadvantage of our proposed method has been verified through extensive ablation\nstudies and comparison with state-of-the-art methods on public datasets across\nmultiple protocols.",

In this paper, we present a new \\emph{nearly linear-time}\nalgorithm of constructing a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-VSDO for any directed input graph\nwith polynomially bounded integer edge weights. More precisely, the presented\noracle attains $\\tilde{O}(m \\log (nW)/ \\epsilon + n \\log^2 (nW)/\\epsilon^2)$\nconstruction time, $\\tilde{O}(n \\log (nW) / \\epsilon)$ size, and\n$\\tilde{O}(1/\\epsilon)$ query time, where $n$ is the number of vertices, $m$ is\nthe number of edges, and $W$ is the maximum edge weight. These bounds are all\noptimal up to polylogarithmic factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first non-trivial algorithm for SSRP/VSDO beating $\\tilde{O}(mn)$\ncomputation time for directed graphs with general edge weight functions, and\nalso the first nearly linear-time construction breaking approximation factor 3.\nSuch a construction has been unknown even for undirected and unweighted graphs.\nIn addition, our result implies that the known conditional lower bounds for the\nexact SSRP computation does not apply to the case of approximation.",

                "summary": "One of the major challenges in particle physics and cosmology is\nunderstanding why there is an asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the\nUniverse. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is thermal leptogenesis,\nwhich involves the addition of at least two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to\nthe standard model. Another possible explanation is baryogenesis through the\nhypermagnetic fields which involves the ${\\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly and helical\nhypermagnetic fields in the early Universe. In this paper, after reviewing the\nthermal leptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly, we\ninvestigate the simplest model that combines these two scenarios and explore\nthe parameter space for optimal results. Our results show that the combined\nscenario permits a specific region of parameter space that is not covered by\neither one separately. In fact, the minimum required mass scale of the RHN and\nstrength of initial hypermagnetic helicity are reduced by one order of\nmagnitude in our model. Moreover, we find that in the combined scenario,\nleptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly can either\namplify or reduce the effect of each other, i.e., the generated asymmetry,\ndepending on the sign of the helical hypermagnetic fields. Finally, we show the\nsurprising result that a drastic amplification can occur even when the initial\nabundance of RHN is its equilibrium value for leptogenesis.",

Here we explored its feasibility in studying the photoinduced\nisomerization of azobenzene. The isomerization of azobenzene changes the\nsolution elastic modulus, and Brillouin scattering is sensitive to these\nchanges. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated the photoswitching of\nazobenzene in DMSO using our home-made VIPA-based high-resolution optical\nBrillouin spectrometer, and confirmed the results by ultraviolet-visible\nspectrophotometry. Remarkable Brillouin frequency shift variations were\nquantitatively recorded upon irradiation, and it was found that this method can\nindeed be used to monitor the isomerization process in situ. Importantly, our\nstrategy also allows us to provide the relationship between the ratio of trans-\nand cis- azobenzene and the Brillouin frequency shift. This shows that\nBrillouin spectroscopy has broad prospects for the characterization of\nazobenzene isomerization and other photo responsive materials.",

                "summary": "Urban transformations have profound societal impact on both individuals and\ncommunities at large. Accurately assessing these shifts is essential for\nunderstanding their underlying causes and ensuring sustainable urban planning.\nTraditional measurements often encounter constraints in spatial and temporal\ngranularity, failing to capture real-time physical changes. While street view\nimagery, capturing the heartbeat of urban spaces from a pedestrian point of\nview, can add as a high-definition, up-to-date, and on-the-ground visual proxy\nof urban change. We curate the largest street view time series dataset to date,\nand propose an end-to-end change detection model to effectively capture\nphysical alterations in the built environment at scale. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method by benchmark comparisons with previous\nliterature and implementing it at the city-wide level. Our approach has the\npotential to supplement existing dataset and serve as a fine-grained and\naccurate assessment of urban change.",

                "summary": "Recently, the Floquet ${\\rm Na_3Bi}$-type material has been proposed as an\nideal platform for realizing various phases, i.e., the spin-degenerate Dirac\nsemimetal (DSM) can be turned into the Weyl semimetal (WSM), and even to the\nWeyl half-metal (WHM). Instead of the conventional electrical methods, we use\nthe RKKY interaction to characterize the topological phase transitions in this\npaper. It is found that detecting the Ising term $J_I$ is feasible for\ndistinguishing the phase transition of DSM/WSM, since the emergence of $J_I$ is\ninduced by the broken spin degeneracy. For the case with impurities deposited\non $z$ axis (the line connecting the Weyl points), the Heisenberg term $J_H$\ncoexists with $J_I$ in the WSM, while $J_H$ is filtered out and only $J_I$\nsurvives in the WHM. This magnetic filtering effect is a reflection of the\nfully spin-polarized property (one spin band is in the WSM phase while the\nother is gapped) of the WHM, and it can act a signal to capture the phase\ntransition of WSM/WHM. This signal can not be disturbed unless the direction of\nthe impurities greatly deviates from $z$ axis. Interestingly, as the impurities\nare moved into the $x$-$y$ plane, there arises another signal (a dip structure\nfor $J_H$ at the phase boundary), which can also identify the phase transition\nof WSM/WHM. Furthermore, we have verified that all magnetic signals are robust\nto the term that breaks the electron-hole symmetry. Besides characterizing the\nphase transitions, our results also suggest that the Floquet DSMs are power\nplatforms for controlling the magnetic interaction.",

The main\ningredient of the arguments lies in constructing new Lyapunov functions\ninvolving the coefficients, the stepsize, and $\\theta$ and deriving a\nminorization condition for the STM. We then generalize the arguments to the\nGalerkin-based full discretizations for a class of monotone SPDEs driven by\ninfinite-dimensional nondegenerate multiplicative trace-class noise. Applying\nthese results to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation indicates that its\nGalerkin-based full discretizations are uniquely ergodic for any interface\nthickness.

                "summary": "In this paper, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed in a\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system.\nTo alleviate the multi-hop attenuation, the semi-self sensing RIS approach is\nadopted, wherein sensors are configured at the RIS to receive the radar echo\nsignal. Focusing on the estimation accuracy, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for\nestimating the direction-of-the-angles is derived as the metric for sensing\nperformance. A joint optimization problem on hybrid beamforming and RIS\nphaseshifts is proposed to minimize the CRB, while maintaining satisfactory\ncommunication performance evaluated by the achievable data rate. The CRB\nminimization problem is first transformed as a more tractable form based on\nFisher information matrix (FIM). To solve the complex non-convex problem, a\ndouble layer loop algorithm is proposed based on penalty concave-convex\nprocedure (penalty-CCCP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) method with two\nsub-problems. Successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm and second order\ncone (SOC) constraints are employed to tackle the non-convexity in the hybrid\nbeamforming optimization. To optimize the unit modulus constrained analog\nbeamforming and phase shifts, manifold optimization (MO) is adopted. Finally,\nthe numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed CRB minimization\nalgorithm, and show the performance improvement compared with other baselines.\nAdditionally, the proposed hybrid beamforming algorithm can achieve\napproximately 96% of the sensing performance exhibited by the full digital\napproach within only a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains.",

However, the coherent\ncoupling between multiple modes at once are difficult to capture by single-pump\nprobe (one-dimensional) spectroscopy, and often remain poorly understood. One\nexample is phonon-mediated amplification of Josephson plasmons in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, in which at least three normal modes of the solid are\ncoherently mixed as a source of enhanced superconductivity. Here, we go beyond\nprevious pump-probe experiments in this system and acquire two-dimensional\nfrequency maps using pairs of mutually delayed, carrier envelope phase stable\nmid-infrared pump pulses, combined with measurements of the time-modulated\nsecond-order nonlinear optical susceptibility. We find that the driven\nzone-center phonons amplify coherent pairs of opposite-momentum Josephson\nplasma polaritons, generating a squeezed state of interlayer phase\nfluctuations. The squeezed state is a potentially important ingredient in the\nmicroscopic physics of photo-induced superconductivity in this and other\nmaterials.",

However,\nuniformly refining AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) of different qualities not only\nlimited optimization capabilities for low-quality AIGIs but also brought\nnegative optimization to high-quality AIGIs. To address this issue, a\nquality-award refiner named Q-Refine is proposed. Based on the preference of\nthe Human Visual System (HVS), Q-Refine uses the Image Quality Assessment (IQA)\nmetric to guide the refining process for the first time, and modify images of\ndifferent qualities through three adaptive pipelines. Experimental shows that\nfor mainstream T2I models, Q-Refine can perform effective optimization to AIGIs\nof different qualities. It can be a general refiner to optimize AIGIs from both\nfidelity and aesthetic quality levels, thus expanding the application of the\nT2I generation models.",

However, existing hierarchical topic classification methods primarily\nrely on external corpora and human intervention. This study proposes a Modified\nContinuous Renormalization (MCR) procedure that acts on the keyword\nco-occurrence network with fractal characteristics to achieve the topic\nhierarchy mining. First, the fractal characteristics in the keyword\nco-occurrence network of Internet review text are identified using a\nbox-covering algorithm for the first time. Then, the MCR algorithm established\non the edge adjacency entropy and the box distance is proposed to obtain the\ntopic hierarchy in the keyword co-occurrence network. Verification data from\nthe Dangdang.com book reviews shows that the MCR constructs topic hierarchies\nwith greater coherence and independence than the HLDA and the Louvain\nalgorithms. Finally, reliable review text classification is achieved using the\nMCR extended bottom level topic categories. The accuracy rate (P), recall rate\n(R) and F1 value of Internet review text classification obtained from the\nMCR-based topic hierarchy are significantly improved compared to four target\ntext classification algorithms.",

However, the scarcity of high-quality, full lifecycle\ndata has been a major constraint in achieving precise predictions. To address\nthis challenge, this paper introduces the CVGAN model, a novel framework\ncapable of generating one-dimensional vibration signals in both horizontal and\nvertical directions, conditioned on historical vibration data and remaining\nuseful life. In addition, we propose an autoregressive generation method that\ncan iteratively utilize previously generated vibration information to guide the\ngeneration of current signals. The effectiveness of the CVGAN model is\nvalidated through experiments conducted on the PHM 2012 dataset. Our findings\ndemonstrate that the CVGAN model, in terms of both MMD and FID metrics,\noutperforms many advanced methods in both autoregressive and non-autoregressive\ngeneration modes. Notably, training using the full lifecycle data generated by\nthe CVGAN model significantly improves the performance of the predictive model.\nThis result highlights the effectiveness of the data generated by CVGans in\nenhancing the predictive power of these models.",

                "summary": "Shocks are often invoked as heating mechanisms in astrophysical systems, with\nboth adiabatic compression and dissipative heating that leading to temperature\nincreases. Whilst shocks are reasonably well understood for ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems, in many astrophysical plasmas, radiation is\nan important phenomena, which can allow energy to leave the system. As such,\nenergy becomes non-conservative which can fundamentally change the behaviour of\nshocks. The energy emitted through optically-thin radiation post-shock can\nexceed the thermal energy increase, resulting in shocks that reduce the\ntemperature of the medium, i.e., cooling shocks that have a net decrease in\ntemperature across the interface. In this paper, semi-analytical solutions for\nradiative shocks are derived to demonstrate that both cooling (temperature\ndecreasing) and heating (temperature increasing) shock solutions are possible\nin radiative MHD. Numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection with\noptically-thin radiative losses also yield both heating and cooling shocks in\nroughly equal abundances. The detected cooling shocks feature a significantly\nlower pressure jump across the shock than their heating counterparts. The\ncompression at the shock front leads to locally-enhanced radiative losses,\nresulting in significant cooling within a few grid cells in the upstream and\ndownstream directions. The presence of temperature-reducing (cooling) shocks is\ncritical in determining the thermal evolution, and heating or cooling, across a\nwealth of radiative astrophysical plasmas.",

In this work, we propose a system that learns rules with\ndiscovered object and relational symbols that encode an arbitrary number of\nobjects and the relations between them, converts those rules to Planning Domain\nDescription Language (PDDL), and generates plans that involve affordances of\nthe arbitrary number of objects to achieve tasks. We validated our system with\nbox-shaped objects in different sizes and showed that the system can develop a\nsymbolic knowledge of pick-up, carry, and place operations, taking into account\nobject compounds in different configurations, such as boxes would be carried\ntogether with a larger box that they are placed on.

                "summary": "Tree-based models have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks,\nincluding time series forecasting. They are increasingly in demand and widely\naccepted because of their comparatively high level of interpretability.\nHowever, many of them suffer from the overfitting problem, which limits their\napplication in real-world decision-making. This problem becomes even more\nsevere in online-forecasting settings where time series observations are\nincrementally acquired, and the distributions from which they are drawn may\nkeep changing over time. In this context, we propose a novel method for the\nonline selection of tree-based models using the TreeSHAP explainability method\nin the task of time series forecasting. We start with an arbitrary set of\ndifferent tree-based models. Then, we outline a performance-based ranking with\na coherent design to make TreeSHAP able to specialize the tree-based\nforecasters across different regions in the input time series. In this\nframework, adequate model selection is performed online, adaptively following\ndrift detection in the time series. In addition, explainability is supported on\nthree levels, namely online input importance, model selection, and model output\nexplanation. An extensive empirical study on various real-world datasets\ndemonstrates that our method achieves excellent or on-par results in comparison\nto the state-of-the-art approaches as well as several baselines.",

We compare the search efficiency with that corresponding to reset to\nthe origin and find that the mean first passage time of the latter can be\nlarger or smaller than the distributed case, depending on whether the resetting\npoints are symmetrically or asymmetrically distributed. In particular, we prove\nthe existence of an optimal reset rate that minimizes the mean first-passage\ntime for distributed resetting to a finite interval if the target is located\noutside this interval. When the target position belongs to the resetting\ninterval or it is infinite then no optimal reset rate exists, but there is an\noptimal resetting interval width or resetting characteristic scale which\nminimizes the mean first-passage time. We also show that the first-passage\ndensity averaged over the resetting points depends on its first moment only. As\na consequence, there is an equivalent point such that the first-passage problem\nwith resetting to that point is statistically equivalent to the case of\ndistributed resetting. We end our study by analyzing the fluctuations of the\nfirst-passage times for these cases. All our analytical results are verified\nthrough numerical simulations.",

The positive-definite\nmetric which ensures reality of the entire spectra of a pseudo-hermitian\noperator, and is used for defining a modified inner-product in the associated\nvector space is also presented. The construction for an N dimensional vector\nspace is based on the generators of SU (N ) in the fundamental representation\nand the identity operator. We apply the results to construct a generic\npseudo-hermitian lattice model of size N with balanced loss-gain. The system is\namenable to periodic as well as open boundary conditions and by construction,\nadmits entirely real spectra along with unitary time-evolution. The tight\nbinding and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) models with nearest neighbour(NN) and\nnext-nearest neighbour(NNN) interaction with balanced loss-gain appear as\nlimiting cases.",

                "summary": "Compared to the generations up to 4G, whose main focus was on broadband and\ncoverage aspects, 5G has expanded the scope of wireless cellular systems\ntowards embracing two new types of connectivity: massive machine-type\ncommunication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC).\nThis paper will discuss the possible evolution of these two types of\nconnectivity within the umbrella of 6G wireless systems. The paper consists of\nthree parts. The first part deals with the connectivity for a massive number of\ndevices. While mMTC research in 5G was predominantly focused on the problem of\nuncoordinated access in the uplink for a large number of devices, the traffic\npatterns in 6G may become more symmetric, leading to closed-loop massive\nconnectivity. One of the drivers for this is distributed learning/inference.\nThe second part of the paper will discuss the evolution of wireless\nconnectivity for critical services. While latency and reliability are tightly\ncoupled in 5G, 6G will support a variety of safety critical control\napplications with different types of timing requirements, as evidenced by the\nemergence of metrics related to information freshness and information value.\nAdditionally, ensuring ultra-high reliability for safety critical control\napplications requires modeling and estimation of the tail statistics of the\nwireless channel, queue length, and delay. The fulfillment of these stringent\nrequirements calls for the development of novel AI-based techniques,\nincorporating optimization theory, explainable AI, generative AI and digital\ntwins. The third part will analyze the coexistence of massive connectivity and\ncritical services. We will consider scenarios in which a massive number of\ndevices need to support traffic patterns of mixed criticality. This will be\nfollowed by a discussion about the management of wireless resources shared by\nservices with different criticality.",

                "summary": "Recently, text-to-image (T2I) synthesis has undergone significant\nadvancements, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM)\nand their enhancement in Large Vision Models (LVM), greatly enhancing the\ninstruction-following capabilities of traditional T2I models. Nevertheless,\nprevious methods focus on improving generation quality but introduce unsafe\nfactors into prompts. We explore that appending specific camera descriptions to\nprompts can enhance safety performance. Consequently, we propose a simple and\nsafe prompt engineering method (SSP) to improve image generation quality by\nproviding optimal camera descriptions. Specifically, we create a dataset from\nmulti-datasets as original prompts. To select the optimal camera, we design an\noptimal camera matching approach and implement a classifier for original\nprompts capable of automatically matching. Appending camera descriptions to\noriginal prompts generates optimized prompts for further LVM image generation.\nExperiments demonstrate that SSP improves semantic consistency by an average of\n16% compared to others and safety metrics by 48.9%.",

We repeated this analysis for\nRiemannian homogeneous spaces, where we derive the reduced equations by\nconsidering an alternative variational problem written in terms of a connection\non the horizontal bundle of the underlying Lie group. We study also the case\nthat the underlying Lie group admits a bi-invariant metric, and consider the\nspecial case that the homogeneous space is in fact a Riemannian symmetric\nspace. These ideas are applied to geodesics for a rigid body on $SO(3)$ to\nderive geodesic equations on the dual of its Lie algebra (a vector space), the\nheavy-top in $SE(3)$ to derive reduced equations of motion on the unit sphere\n$S^2$, geodesics on $S^2$ as a Riemannian symmetric space endowed with a\nbi-invariant metric and optimal control problems for applications to robotic\nmanipulators.",

While previous works have explored image generation conditioned on\nscene graphs or layouts, our task is distinctive and important as it involves\ngenerating scene graphs themselves unconditionally from noise, enabling\nefficient and interpretable control for image generation. Our task is\nchallenging, requiring the generation of plausible scene graphs with\nheterogeneous attributes for nodes (objects) and edges (relations among\nobjects), including continuous object bounding boxes and discrete object and\nrelation categories. We introduce a novel diffusion model, DiffuseSG, that\njointly models the adjacency matrix along with heterogeneous node and edge\nattributes. We explore various types of encodings for the categorical data,\nrelaxing it into a continuous space. With a graph transformer being the\ndenoiser, DiffuseSG successively denoises the scene graph representation in a\ncontinuous space and discretizes the final representation to generate the clean\nscene graph. Additionally, we introduce an IoU regularization to enhance the\nempirical performance. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods in\nscene graph generation on the Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets, both on\nstandard and newly introduced metrics that better capture the problem\ncomplexity. Moreover, we demonstrate the additional benefits of our model in\ntwo downstream applications: 1) excelling in a series of scene graph completion\ntasks, and 2) improving scene graph detection models by using extra training\nsamples generated from DiffuseSG.",

In addition, we show that if $T$\nis a homomorphism on a Fr\\'{e}chet space $X$ and there exists a dense set of\nvectors with null orbit, then for each $y \\in X$ the set of all vectors $x \\in\nX$ such that $\\lim_{n \\in A}T^nx=y$ for some $A\\subseteq \\omega$ with nonzero\nupper asymptotic density is either empty or comeager.\n  In the special case of linear dynamical systems on Banach spaces with a dense\nset of uniformly recurrent vectors, we obtain that $T$ is upper frequently\nhypercyclic if and only if there exists a hypercyclic vector $x \\in X$ for\nwhich $\\lim_{n \\in A}T^nx=0$ for some $A\\subseteq \\omega$ with nonzero upper\nasymptotic density.",

                "summary": "Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) offers a promising solution for large-scale\nsolar energy utilization as Thermal Energy Storage (TES) enables electricity\ngeneration independently of daily solar fluctuations, shifting to high-priced\nelectricity intervals. The development of dispatch planning tools is mandatory\nto account for uncertainties associated with solar irradiation and electricity\nprice forecasts as well as limited storage capacity. This study proposes the\nStochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program (SMILP) to maximize expected profit\nwithin a specified scenario space. The SMILP scenario space is generated by\ndifferent Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function percentiles of the\npotential solar energy to accumulate in storage and the expected profit is\nestimated using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. SMILP exhibits\nrobust performance, however, its computational time poses a challenge. Thus,\nthree heuristic solutions are developed which run a set of deterministic\noptimizations on different historical weather profiles to generate candidate\ndispatching plans (DPs). The candidate DP with the best average performance on\nall profiles is then selected. The new methods were applied to a case study for\na 115 MW CST plant in South Australia. When the historical database has a\nlimited set of historical weather profiles, the SMILP achieves 6% to 9% higher\nprofit than the closest benchmark when the DP is applied to novel weather\nconditions. With a large historical weather data, the performance of SMILP and\nHeuristic-2 becomes nearly identical because the SMILP can only utilize a\nlimited number of trajectories for optimization without becoming\ncomputationally infeasible. In this case, Heuristic-2 emerges a practical\nalternative, since it provides similar average profit in a reasonable time\n(saving about 7 hours in computing time).",

                "summary": "Linear codes are widely studied in coding theory as they have nice\napplications in distributed storage, combinatorics, lattices, cryptography and\nso on. Constructing linear codes with desirable properties is an interesting\nresearch topic. In this paper, based on the augmentation technique, we present\ntwo families of linear codes from some functions over finite fields. The first\nfamily of linear codes is constructed from monomial functions over finite\nfields. The locality of them is determined and the weight distributions of two\nsubfamilies of the codes are also given. An infinite family of locally\nrecoverable codes which are at least almost optimal and some optimal\nrecoverable codes are obtained from the linear codes. In particular, the two\nsubfamilies of the codes are proved to be both optimally or almost optimally\nextendable and self-orthogonal. The second family of linear codes is\nconstructed from weakly regular bent functions over finite fields and their\nweight distribution is determined. This family of codes is proved to have\nlocality 3 for some cases and is conjectured to have locality 2 for other\ncases. Particularly, two families of optimal locally recoverable codes are\nderived from the linear codes. Besides, this family of codes is also proved to\nbe both optimally or almost optimally extendable and self-orthogonal.",

This is achieved by\ncombining suitable fixed-point and energy arguments and by uncovering a\nnonlocal in time, integral conserved quantity. After giving a complete\nclassification of steady states in terms of elliptic functions, we next show\nthat every solution converges to a steady state as $t \\to \\infty$.

                "title": "Joint Offloading and Resource Allocation for Hybrid Cloud and Edge\n  Computing in SAGINs: A Decision Assisted Hybrid Action Space Deep\n  Reinforcement Learning Approach",
                "summary": "In recent years, the amalgamation of satellite communications and aerial\nplatforms into space-air-ground integrated network (SAGINs) has emerged as an\nindispensable area of research for future communications due to the global\ncoverage capacity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the flexible\nDeployment of aerial platforms. This paper presents a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL)-based approach for the joint optimization of offloading and\nresource allocation in hybrid cloud and multi-access edge computing (MEC)\nscenarios within SAGINs. The proposed system considers the presence of multiple\nsatellites, clouds and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The multiple tasks from\nground users are modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). With the goal of\nreducing energy consumption and latency in MEC, we propose a novel multi-agent\nalgorithm based on DRL that optimizes both the offloading strategy and the\nallocation of resources in the MEC infrastructure within SAGIN. A hybrid action\nalgorithm is utilized to address the challenge of hybrid continuous and\ndiscrete action space in the proposed problems, and a decision-assisted DRL\nmethod is adopted to reduce the impact of unavailable actions in the training\nprocess of DRL. Through extensive simulations, the results demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed learning-based scheme, the proposed approach\nconsistently outperforms benchmark schemes, highlighting its superior\nperformance and potential for practical applications.",

This paper introduces Spiker+, a\ncomprehensive framework for generating efficient, low-power, and low-area\ncustomized Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) accelerators on FPGA for inference at\nthe edge. Spiker+ presents a configurable multi-layer hardware SNN, a library\nof highly efficient neuron architectures, and a design framework, enabling the\ndevelopment of complex neural network accelerators with few lines of Python\ncode. Spiker+ is tested on two benchmark datasets, the MNIST and the Spiking\nHeidelberg Digits (SHD). On the MNIST, it demonstrates competitive performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators. It outperforms them in terms of\nresource allocation, with a requirement of 7,612 logic cells and 18 Block RAMs\n(BRAMs), which makes it fit in very small FPGA, and power consumption, draining\nonly 180mW for a complete inference on an input image. The latency is\ncomparable to the ones observed in the state-of-the-art, with 780us/img. To the\nauthors' knowledge, Spiker+ is the first SNN accelerator tested on the SHD. In\nthis case, the accelerator requires 18,268 logic cells and 51 BRAM, with an\noverall power consumption of 430mW and a latency of 54 us for a complete\ninference on input data. This underscores the significance of Spiker+ in the\nhardware-accelerated SNN landscape, making it an excellent solution to deploy\nconfigurable and tunable SNN architectures in resource and power-constrained\nedge applications.",

                "summary": "This paper introduces HAAQI-Net, a non-intrusive deep learning model for\nmusic audio quality assessment tailored for hearing aid users. Unlike\ntraditional methods like the Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI), which\nrely on intrusive comparisons to a reference signal, HAAQI-Net offers a more\naccessible and efficient alternative. Using a bidirectional Long Short-Term\nMemory (BLSTM) architecture with attention mechanisms and features from the\npre-trained BEATs model, HAAQI-Net predicts HAAQI scores directly from music\naudio clips and hearing loss patterns. Results show HAAQI-Net's effectiveness,\nwith predicted scores achieving a Linear Correlation Coefficient (LCC) of\n0.9368, a Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9486, and a Mean\nSquared Error (MSE) of 0.0064, reducing inference time from 62.52 seconds to\n2.54 seconds. Although effective, feature extraction via the large BEATs model\nincurs computational overhead. To address this, a knowledge distillation\nstrategy creates a student distillBEATs model, distilling information from the\nteacher BEATs model during HAAQI-Net training, reducing required parameters.\nThe distilled HAAQI-Net maintains strong performance with an LCC of 0.9071, an\nSRCC of 0.9307, and an MSE of 0.0091, while reducing parameters by 75.85% and\ninference time by 96.46%. This reduction enhances HAAQI-Net's efficiency and\nscalability, making it viable for real-world music audio quality assessment in\nhearing aid settings. This work also opens avenues for further research into\noptimizing deep learning models for specific applications, contributing to\naudio signal processing and quality assessment by providing insights into\ndeveloping efficient and accurate models for practical applications in hearing\naid technology.",

To optimise future materials, understanding the microstructure is\ncritically important. Here, we present two novel approaches based on artificial\nintelligence that allow the segmentation of the phases of a microstructure for\nwhich simple numerical approaches, such as thresholding, are not applicable:\nOne is based on the nnU-Net neural network, and the other on generative\nadversarial networks (GAN). Using large panoramic scanning electron microscopy\nimages of dual-phase steels as a case study, we demonstrate how both methods\neffectively segment intricate microstructural details, including martensite,\nferrite, and damage sites, for subsequent analysis. Either method shows\nsubstantial generalizability across a range of image sizes and conditions,\nincluding heat-treated microstructures with different phase configurations. The\nnnU-Net excels in mapping large image areas. Conversely, the GAN-based method\nperforms reliably on smaller images, providing greater step-by-step control and\nflexibility over the segmentation process. This study highlights the benefits\nof segmented microstructural data for various purposes, such as calculating\nphase fractions, modelling material behaviour through finite element\nsimulation, and conducting geometrical analyses of damage sites and the local\nproperties of their surrounding microstructure.",

                "summary": "We introduce the study of search games between a mobile Searcher and an\nimmobile Hider in a new setting in which the Searcher has some potentially\nerroneous information, i.e., a prediction on the Hider's position. The\nobjective is to establish tight tradeoffs between the consistency of a search\nstrategy (i.e., its worst case expected payoff assuming the prediction is\ncorrect) and its robustness (i.e., the worst case expected payoff with no\nassumptions on the quality of the prediction). Our study is the first to\naddress the full power of mixed (randomized) strategies; previous work focused\nonly on deterministic strategies, or relied on stochastic assumptions that do\nnot guarantee worst-case robustness in adversarial situations. We give\nPareto-optimal strategies for three fundamental problems, namely searching in\ndiscrete locations, searching with stochastic overlook, and searching in the\ninfinite line. As part of our contribution, we provide a novel framework for\nproving optimal tradeoffs in search games which is applicable, more broadly, to\nany two-person zero-sum games in learning-augmented settings.",

                "summary": "The trend toward specialized processing devices such as TPUs, DPUs, GPUs, and\nFPGAs has exposed the weaknesses of PCIe in interconnecting these devices and\ntheir hosts. Several attempts have been proposed to improve, augment, or\ndownright replace PCIe, and more recently, these efforts have converged into a\nstandard called Compute Express Link (CXL). CXL is already on version 2.0 in\nterms of commercial availability, but its potential to radically change the\nconventional server architecture has only just started to surface. For example,\nCXL can increase the bandwidth and quantity of memory available to any single\nmachine beyond what that machine can originally provide, most importantly, in a\nmanner that is fully transparent to software applications.\n  We argue, however, that CXL can have a broader impact beyond memory expansion\nand deeply affect the architecture of data-intensive systems. In a nutshell,\nwhile the cloud favored scale-out approaches that grew in capacity by adding\nfull servers to a rack, CXL brings back scale-up architectures that can grow by\nfine-tuning individual resources, all while transforming the rack into a large\nshared-memory machine. In this paper, we describe why such architectural\ntransformations are now possible, how they benefit emerging heterogeneous\nhardware platforms for data-intensive systems, and the associated research\nchallenges.",

In\nthis study, an effective vibration testing methodology is introduced for the\nexperimental identification of these secondary resonances. The proposed method\nrelies on phase-locked loop control combined with adaptive filters for online\nFourier decomposition. To this end, the concept of a resonant phase lag is\nexploited to define the target phase lag to be followed during the experimental\ncontinuation process. The method is demonstrated using two systems featuring\ncubic nonlinearities, namely a numerical Duffing oscillator and a physical\nexperiment comprising a clamped-clamped thin beam. The obtained results\nhighlight that the control scheme can accurately characterize secondary\nresonances as well as track their backbone curves. A particularly salient\nfeature of the developed algorithm is that, starting from the rest position, it\nfacilitates an automatic and smooth dynamic state transfer toward one point of\na subharmonic isolated branch, hence, inducing branch switching.",

However, we still lack\nempirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their\nrequirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities. We aim to\ncontribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects\nhave on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement. We\nconduct a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and\nuniversity generate domain models from four natural language requirements\ncontaining different quality defects. We evaluate the resulting models using\nboth frequentist and Bayesian data analysis. Contrary to our expectations, our\nresults show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the\nresulting domain models. The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong\neffect on various properties of the resulting domain models. Most notably,\nambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models. Despite\nbeing equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the\nBayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have\nvastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve\ndifferent levels of attention. Our employed method can be further utilized by\nresearchers to improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements\nquality.",

                "summary": "Marker code is an effective coding scheme to protect data from insertions and\ndeletions. It has potential applications in future storage systems, such as DNA\nstorage and racetrack memory. When decoding marker codes, perfect channel state\ninformation (CSI), i.e., insertion and deletion probabilities, are required to\ndetect insertion and deletion errors. Sometimes, the perfect CSI is not easy to\nobtain or the accurate channel model is unknown. Therefore, it is deserved to\ndevelop detecting algorithms for marker code without the knowledge of perfect\nCSI. In this paper, we propose two CSI-agnostic detecting algorithms for marker\ncode based on deep learning. The first one is a model-driven deep learning\nmethod, which deep unfolds the original iterative detecting algorithm of marker\ncode. In this method, CSI become weights in neural networks and these weights\ncan be learned from training data. The second one is a data-driven method which\nis an end-to-end system based on the deep bidirectional gated recurrent unit\nnetwork. Simulation results show that error performances of the proposed\nmethods are significantly better than that of the original detection algorithm\nwith CSI uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed data-driven method exhibits\nbetter error performances than other methods for unknown channel models.",

Most of the phenomena observed and\nwell-recognized for inertia particles in incompressible wall-bounded turbulent\nflows, such as the near-wall preferential accumulation and clustering beneath\nthe low-speed streaks, the flatter mean velocity profiles and the trend\nvariation of the particle velocity fluctuations, are identified in the\ncompressible turbulent boundary layer as well. However, we find that the\ncompressibility effects are significant for large inertia particles. As the\nMach number increases, the near-wall accumulation and the small-scale\nclustering are alleviated, which is probably caused by the variation of the\nfluid density and viscosity that are crucial to particle dynamics. This can be\naffected by the fact that the forces acting on the particles with the viscous\nStokes number greater than 500 are modulated by the comparatively high particle\nMach numbers in the near-wall region. This is also the reason for the abatement\nof the streamwise particle velocity fluctuation intensities with the Mach\nnumbers.",

                "summary": "Utilizing the recently established connection between Palatini-like gravity\nand linear Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models, we have formulated\nan approach that facilitates the examination of Bose gases. Our primary focus\nis on the ideal Bose-Einstein condensate and liquid helium, chosen as\nillustrative examples to underscore the feasibility of tabletop experiments in\nassessing gravity models. The non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate imposes\nconstraints on linear GUP and Palatini $f(R)$ gravity (Eddington-inspired\nBorn-Infeld gravity) within the ranges of $-10^{12}\\lesssim\\sigma\\lesssim\n3\\times 10^{24}{\\text{ s}}/{\\text{kg m}}$ and\n$-10^{-1}\\lesssim\\bar\\beta\\lesssim 10^{11} \\text{ m}^2$\n($-4\\times10^{-1}\\lesssim\\epsilon\\lesssim 4\\times 10^{11} \\text{ m}^2$),\nrespectively. In contrast, the properties of liquid helium suggest more\nrealistic bounds, specifically $-10^{23}\\lesssim\\sigma\\lesssim 10^{23}{\\text{\ns}}/{\\text{kg m}}$ and $-10^{9}\\lesssim\\bar\\beta\\lesssim 10^{9} \\text{ m}^2$.\nAdditionally, we argue that the newly developed method employing Earth seismic\nwaves provides improved constraints for quantum and modified gravity by\napproximately one order of magnitude.",

                "summary": "We describe a new general method for segmentation in MRI scans using\nTopological Data Analysis (TDA), offering several advantages over traditional\nmachine learning approaches. It works in three steps, first identifying the\nwhole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a\ndistinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the\nvarious components of the segmentation. Although convoking classical ideas of\nTDA, such an algorithm has never been proposed separately from deep learning\nmethods. To achieve this, our approach takes into account, in addition to the\nhomology of the image, the localization of representative cycles, a piece of\ninformation that seems never to have been exploited in this context. In\nparticular, it offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for\nlarge annotated data sets. TDA also provides a more interpretable and stable\nframework for segmentation by explicitly mapping topological features to\nsegmentation components. By adapting the geometric object to be detected, the\nalgorithm can be adjusted to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We\ncarefully study the examples of glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a\nsphere is to be detected, as well as myocardium in cardiac MRI, involving a\ncylinder, and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are\ncircles. We compare our method to state-of-the-art algorithms.",

Video compression\nhas long been regarded as the primary means of efficiently managing the\nsubstantial multimedia traffic generated by video-capturing devices.\nNevertheless, video compression algorithms entail significant computational\ndemands in order to achieve substantial compression ratios. This complexity\npresents a formidable challenge when implementing efficient video coding\nstandards in resource-constrained embedded systems, such as IoT edge node\ncameras. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces NU-Class Net, an\ninnovative deep-learning model designed to mitigate compression artifacts\nstemming from lossy compression codecs. This enhancement significantly elevates\nthe perceptible quality of low-bit-rate videos. By employing the NU-Class Net,\nthe video encoder within the video-capturing node can reduce output quality,\nthereby generating low-bit-rate videos and effectively curtailing both\ncomputation and bandwidth requirements at the edge. On the decoder side, which\nis typically less encumbered by resource limitations, NU-Class Net is applied\nafter the video decoder to compensate for artifacts and approximate the quality\nof the original video.

                "summary": "Multi-class colorectal tissue classification is a challenging problem that is\ntypically addressed in a setting, where it is assumed that ample amounts of\ntraining data is available. However, manual annotation of fine-grained\ncolorectal tissue samples of multiple classes, especially the rare ones like\nstromal tumor and anal cancer is laborious and expensive. To address this, we\npropose a knowledge distillation-based approach, named KD-CTCNet, that\neffectively captures local texture information from few tissue samples, through\na distillation loss, to improve the standard CNN features. The resulting\nenriched feature representation achieves improved classification performance\nspecifically in low data regimes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets\nof colorectal tissues reveal the merits of the proposed contributions, with a\nconsistent gain achieved over different approaches across low data settings.\nThe code and models are publicly available on GitHub.",

                "summary": "The electromagnetic inverse problem has long been a research hotspot. This\nstudy aims to reverse radar view angles in synthetic aperture radar (SAR)\nimages given a target model. Nonetheless, the scarcity of SAR data, combined\nwith the intricate background interference and imaging mechanisms, limit the\napplications of existing learning-based approaches. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an interactive deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nframework, where an electromagnetic simulator named differentiable SAR render\n(DSR) is embedded to facilitate the interaction between the agent and the\nenvironment, simulating a human-like process of angle prediction. Specifically,\nDSR generates SAR images at arbitrary view angles in real-time. And the\ndifferences in sequential and semantic aspects between the view\nangle-corresponding images are leveraged to construct the state space in DRL,\nwhich effectively suppress the complex background interference, enhance the\nsensitivity to temporal variations, and improve the capability to capture\nfine-grained information. Additionally, in order to maintain the stability and\nconvergence of our method, a series of reward mechanisms, such as memory\ndifference, smoothing and boundary penalty, are utilized to form the final\nreward function. Extensive experiments performed on both simulated and real\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.\nWhen utilized in the cross-domain area, the proposed method greatly mitigates\ninconsistency between simulated and real domains, outperforming reference\nmethods significantly.",

A crucial step\nof FL, that of aggregating local models to produce the global one, shares many\nsimilarities with public decision-making, and elections in particular. In that\ncontext, a major weakness of FL, namely its vulnerability to poisoning attacks,\ncan be interpreted as a consequence of the one person one vote (henceforth\n1p1v) principle underpinning most contemporary aggregation rules. In this\npaper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic\nvoting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based\nelections. Our theoretical analysis establishes that FedQV is a truthful\nmechanism in which bidding according to one's true valuation is a dominant\nstrategy that achieves a convergence rate that matches those of\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our empirical analysis using multiple\nreal-world datasets validates the superior performance of FedQV against\npoisoning attacks. It also shows that combining FedQV with unequal voting\n``budgets'' according to a reputation score increases its performance benefits\neven further. Finally, we show that FedQV can be easily combined with\nByzantine-robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to enhance its robustness\nagainst both poisoning and privacy attacks.",

                "summary": "Diagnosis of bearing faults is paramount to reducing maintenance costs and\noperational breakdowns. Bearing faults are primary contributors to machine\nvibrations, and analyzing their signal morphology offers insights into their\nhealth status. Unfortunately, existing approaches are optimized for controlled\nenvironments, neglecting realistic conditions such as time-varying rotational\nspeeds and the vibration's non-stationary nature. This paper presents a fusion\nof time-frequency analysis and deep learning techniques to diagnose bearing\nfaults under time-varying speeds and varying noise levels. First, we formulate\nthe bearing fault-induced vibrations and discuss the link between their\nnon-stationarity and the bearing's inherent and operational parameters. We also\nelucidate quadratic time-frequency distributions and validate their\neffectiveness in resolving distinctive dynamic patterns associated with\ndifferent bearing faults. Based on this, we design a time-frequency\nconvolutional neural network (TF-CNN) to diagnose various faults in\nrolling-element bearings. Our experimental findings undeniably demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of TF-CNN in comparison to recently developed techniques.\nThey also assert its versatility in capturing fault-relevant non-stationary\nfeatures that couple with speed changes and show its exceptional resilience to\nnoise, consistently surpassing competing methods across various signal-to-noise\nratios and performance metrics. Altogether, the TF-CNN achieves substantial\naccuracy improvements up to 15%, in severe noise conditions.",

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a meticulously crafted workflow that implements accurate physical\nmodeling to learn the enhanced 3D generative model from synthetic 2D data.\nDuring inference, we integrate optimization modules to bridge the gap between\nrealistic appearances and coarse 3D shapes. Specifically, En3D comprises three\nmodules: a 3D generator that accurately models generalizable 3D humans with\nrealistic appearance from synthesized balanced, diverse, and structured human\nimages; a geometry sculptor that enhances shape quality using multi-view normal\nconstraints for intricate human anatomy; and a texturing module that\ndisentangles explicit texture maps with fidelity and editability, leveraging\nsemantical UV partitioning and a differentiable rasterizer. Experimental\nresults show that our approach significantly outperforms prior works in terms\nof image quality, geometry accuracy and content diversity. We also showcase the\napplicability of our generated avatars for animation and editing, as well as\nthe scalability of our approach for content-style free adaptation.",

The\ndevelopment of a microwave-domain surface scattering model and its\nreversibility are poised to play a pivotal role in enhancing the authenticity\nof SAR image simulations and facilitating the reconstruction of target\nparameters. Drawing inspiration from the field of computer graphics, this paper\nproposes a surface microwave rendering model that comprehensively considers\nboth Specular and Diffuse contributions. The model is analytically represented\nby the coherent spatially varying bidirectional scattering distribution\nfunction (CSVBSDF) based on the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and the\nperturbation method (SPM). And SAR imaging is achieved through the synergistic\ncombination of ray tracing and fast mapping projection techniques. Furthermore,\na differentiable ray tracing (DRT) engine based on SAR images was constructed\nfor CSVBSDF surface scattering parameter learning. Within this SAR image\nsimulation engine, the use of differentiable reverse ray tracing enables the\nrapid estimation of parameter gradients from SAR images. The effectiveness of\nthis approach has been validated through simulations and comparisons with real\nSAR images. By learning the surface scattering parameters, substantial\nenhancements in SAR image simulation performance under various observation\nconditions have been demonstrated.",

We consider the scenario to send a semantic source\nconsisting of an observation state and its corresponding semantic state, both\nof which are recovered at the receiver. To derive the performance limitation,\nwe adopt the semantic rate-distortion function (SRDF) to study the relationship\namong the minimum compression rate, observation distortion, semantic\ndistortion, and channel capacity. For the case with unknown semantic source\ndistribution, while only a set of the source samples is available, we propose a\nneural-network-based method by leveraging the generative networks to learn the\nsemantic source distribution. Furthermore, for a special case where the\nsemantic state is a deterministic function of the observation, we design a\ncascade neural network to estimate the SRDF. For the case with perfectly known\nsemantic source distribution, we propose a general Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to\neffectively compute the SRDF.

Numerical reproduction of this process is therefore\nessential for developing robust solar models. Our goal is to assess\nplasmoid-mediated reconnection across various numerical resistivity models in\norder to investigate how plasmoid numbers and reconnection rates depend on the\nLundquist number. We used the Bifrost code to drive magnetic reconnection in a\n2D coronal fan-spine topology, carrying out a parametric study of several\nexperiments with different numerical resolution and resistivity models. We\nemployed three anomalous resistivity models: (1) the original hyper-diffusion\nfrom Bifrost, (2) a resistivity proportional to current density, and (3) a\nresistivity quadratically proportional to electron drift velocity. For\ncomparisons, experiments with uniform resistivity were also run.\nPlasmoid-mediated reconnection is obtained in most of the experiments. With\nuniform resistivity, increasing the resolution reveals higher plasmoid\nfrequency with weaker scaling to the Lundquist number, obtaining 7.9-12\nplasmoids per minute for $S_L\\in[1.8 \\times 10^4, 2.6\\times 10^5]$ with a\nscaling of $S_L^{0.210}$ in the highest-resolution resistivity cases,\ntranscending into Petschek reconnection in the high-$S_L$ limit and\nSweet-Parker reconnection in the low-$S_L$ limit. Anomalous resistivity leads\nto similar results even with lower resolution. The drift-velocity-dependent\nresistivity excellently reproduces Petschek reconnection for any Lundquist\nnumber, and similar results are seen with resistivity proportional to\ncurrent-density. Among the different resistivity models applied on the given\nnumerical resolution, the hyper-diffusion model reproduced plasmoid\ncharacteristics in closest resemblance to those obtained with uniform\nresistivity at a significantly higher resolution.",

However, large-scale building extraction demands higher\ndiversity in training samples. In this paper, we construct a Global Building\nSemantic Segmentation (GBSS) dataset (The dataset will be released), which\ncomprises 116.9k pairs of samples (about 742k buildings) from six continents.\nThere are significant variations of building samples in terms of size and\nstyle, so the dataset can be a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the\ngeneralization and robustness of building semantic segmentation models.

However, most existing VL-SSL frameworks are trained\nend-to-end, which is computation-heavy and can lose vital prior information\nembedded in pre-trained encoders. To address both issues, we introduce the\nbackbone-agnostic Adaptor framework, which preserves medical knowledge in\npre-trained image and text encoders by keeping them frozen, and employs a\nlightweight Adaptor module for cross-modal learning. Experiments on medical\nimage classification and segmentation tasks across three datasets reveal that\nour framework delivers competitive performance while cutting trainable\nparameters by over 90% compared to current pre-training approaches.

We evaluated our method on a\ncomprehensive dataset of 400 trees and achieved a DBH estimation accuracy with\nan error rate of less than 2.5%.

                "summary": "Identifying labels that did not appear during training, known as multi-label\nzero-shot learning, is a non-trivial task in computer vision. To this end,\nrecent studies have attempted to explore the multi-modal knowledge of\nvision-language pre-training (VLP) models by knowledge distillation, allowing\nto recognize unseen labels in an open-vocabulary manner. However, experimental\nevidence shows that knowledge distillation is suboptimal and provides limited\nperformance gain in unseen label prediction. In this paper, a novel query-based\nknowledge sharing paradigm is proposed to explore the multi-modal knowledge\nfrom the pretrained VLP model for open-vocabulary multi-label classification.\nSpecifically, a set of learnable label-agnostic query tokens is trained to\nextract critical vision knowledge from the input image, and further shared\nacross all labels, allowing them to select tokens of interest as visual clues\nfor recognition. Besides, we propose an effective prompt pool for robust label\nembedding, and reformulate the standard ranking learning into a form of\nclassification to allow the magnitude of feature vectors for matching, which\nboth significantly benefit label recognition. Experimental results show that\nour framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot\ntask by 5.9% and 4.5% in mAP on the NUS-WIDE and Open Images, respectively.",

                "summary": "Data-to-text (D2T) generation aims to transform structured data into natural\nlanguage text. Data-to-text pre-training has proved to be powerful in enhancing\nD2T generation and yields impressive performances. However, previous\npre-training methods either oversimplified structured data into a sequence\nwithout considering input structures or designed training objectives tailored\nfor a specific data structure (e.g., table or knowledge graph). In this paper,\nwe unify different types of structured data (i.e., table, key-value data,\nknowledge graph) into the graph format and cast different data-to-text\ngeneration tasks as graph-to-text generation. To effectively exploit the\nstructural information of the input graph, we propose a structure-enhanced\npre-training method for D2T generation by designing a structure-enhanced\nTransformer. Concretely, we devise a position matrix for the Transformer,\nencoding relative positional information of connected nodes in the input graph.\nIn addition, we propose a new attention matrix to incorporate graph structures\ninto the original Transformer by taking the available explicit connectivity\nstructure into account. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show\nthe effectiveness of our model. Our source codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/unid2t.",

                "summary": "We study the Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium (BCCE) of continuous and\ndiscretised first-price and all-pay auctions under the standard symmetric\nindependent private-values model. Our study is motivated by the question of how\nthe canonical Bayes-Nash equilibrium (BNE) of the auction relates to the\noutcomes learned by buyers utilising no-regret algorithms. Numerical\nexperiments show that in two buyer first-price auctions the Wasserstein-$2$\ndistance of buyers' marginal bid distributions decline as $O(1/n)$ in the\ndiscretisation size in instances where the prior distribution is concave,\nwhereas all-pay auctions exhibit similar behaviour without prior dependence. To\nexplain this convergence to a near-equilibrium, we study uniqueness of the BCCE\nof the continuous auction. Our uniqueness results translate to provable\nconvergence of deterministic self-play to a near equilibrium outcome in these\nauctions. In the all-pay auction, we show that independent of the prior\ndistribution there is a unique BCCE with symmetric, differentiable, and\nincreasing bidding strategies, which is equivalent to the unique strict BNE. In\nthe first-price auction, we need stronger conditions. Either the prior is\nstrictly concave or the learning algorithm has to be restricted to strictly\nincreasing strategies. Without such strong assumptions, no-regret algorithms\ncan end up in low-price pooling strategies. This is important because it proves\nthat in repeated first-price auctions such as in display ad actions,\nalgorithmic collusion cannot be ruled out without further assumptions even if\nall bidders rely on no-regret algorithms.",

We show that it strongly modifies intensity correlation measurements\nin a Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment and leads to errors in indistinguishability\nestimations.

We propose a new\napproach to enhance inaccurate regions in semantic masks, particularly in\nmarginal areas. Utilizing the geometric information present in depth images,\nthis method enables accurate removal of dynamic objects, thereby reducing the\nprobability of camera drift. Additionally, we introduce a keyframe selection\nstrategy for dynamic scenes, which enhances camera tracking robustness against\nlarge-scale objects and improves the efficiency of mapping.

                "summary": "In many recent works, the potential of Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA)\nfeatures to numerically characterize, in particular, single-objective\ncontinuous optimization problems has been demonstrated. These numerical\nfeatures provide the input for all kinds of machine learning tasks on\ncontinuous optimization problems, ranging, i.a., from High-level Property\nPrediction to Automated Algorithm Selection and Automated Algorithm\nConfiguration. Without ELA features, analyzing and understanding the\ncharacteristics of single-objective continuous optimization problems is -- to\nthe best of our knowledge -- very limited.\n  Yet, despite their usefulness, as demonstrated in several past works, ELA\nfeatures suffer from several drawbacks. These include, in particular, (1.) a\nstrong correlation between multiple features, as well as (2.) its very limited\napplicability to multi-objective continuous optimization problems. As a remedy,\nrecent works proposed deep learning-based approaches as alternatives to ELA. In\nthese works, e.g., point-cloud transformers were used to characterize an\noptimization problem's fitness landscape. However, these approaches require a\nlarge amount of labeled training data.\n  Within this work, we propose a hybrid approach, Deep-ELA, which combines (the\nbenefits of) deep learning and ELA features. Specifically, we pre-trained four\ntransformers on millions of randomly generated optimization problems to learn\ndeep representations of the landscapes of continuous single- and\nmulti-objective optimization problems. Our proposed framework can either be\nused out-of-the-box for analyzing single- and multi-objective continuous\noptimization problems, or subsequently fine-tuned to various tasks focussing on\nalgorithm behavior and problem understanding.",

In light\nof certain misinterpretations concerning the contributions and proofs in that\npaper, we focus on providing detailed explanations in this work. We begin by\ndelineating the core innovation of the constructive approach, shedding light on\nthe pivotal concept of algorithm designability. We address the overlooked\nwhite-box diagonalization method and highlight the concept of an almost\nindependent solution space. In response to specific misunderstandings, such as\nthe concerns surrounding the assumptions of Lemma 3.1, we offer comprehensive\nclarifications aimed at improving the comprehension of the proof. We are\ngrateful for the feedback received on our prior paper and hope this work can\nfoster a more well-informed discussion.",

                "summary": "We establish that the charmed hadrons start dissociating at the chiral\ncrossover temperature, ${T_{pc}}$, leading to the appearance of charm degrees\nfreedom carrying fractional baryon number. Our method is based on analyzing the\nsecond and fourth-order cumulants of charm (${C}$) fluctuations, and their\ncorrelations with baryon number (${B}$), electric charge (${Q}$) and\nstrangeness (${S}$) fluctuations. The first-time calculation of the ${QC}$\ncorrelations on the high statistics datasets of the HotQCD Collaboration\nenables us to disentangle the contributions from different electrically-charged\ncharm subsectors in the hadronic phase. In particular, we see an enhancement\nover the PDG expectation in the fractional contribution of the ${|Q|}=2$ charm\nsubsector to the total charm partial pressure for ${T<T_{pc}}$; this\nenhancement is in agreement with the Quark Model extended Hadron Resonance Gas\n(QM-HRG) model calculations. Furthermore, the agreement of QM-HRG calculations\nwith the projections onto charmed baryonic and mesonic correlations in\ndifferent charm subsectors indicates the existence of not-yet-discovered\ncharmed hadrons in all charm subsectors below ${T_{pc}}$. We aim at determining\nthe relevant degrees of freedom in temperature range ${T_{pc}<T<340 \\text{\nMeV}}$ by assuming the existence of a non-interacting gas of charmed\nquasi-particles composed of meson, baryon and quark-like excitations above\n$T_{pc}$. Our data suggest that the particles with quantum numbers consistent\nwith quarks start appearing at $T_{pc}$.",

                "summary": "Misinformation poses a variety of risks, such as undermining public trust and\ndistorting factual discourse. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been\nshown effective in mitigating misinformation, particularly in handling\nstatements where enough context is provided. However, they struggle to assess\nambiguous or context-deficient statements accurately. This work introduces a\nnew method to resolve uncertainty in such statements. We propose a framework to\ncategorize missing information and publish category labels for the LIAR-New\ndataset, which is adaptable to cross-domain content with missing information.\nWe then leverage this framework to generate effective user queries for missing\ncontext. Compared to baselines, our method improves the rate at which generated\nquestions are answerable by the user by 38 percentage points and classification\nperformance by over 10 percentage points macro F1. Thus, this approach may\nprovide a valuable component for future misinformation mitigation pipelines.",

The\ncontrol objective involves a convex regularisation function, denoted as $h$,\nwith regularisation strength determined by the weight $\\tau\\ge 0$. The setting\ncovers regularised relaxed control problems. Under suitable conditions, we\nestablish the relative smoothness and convexity of the control objective with\nrespect to the Bregman divergence of $h$, and prove linear convergence of the\nalgorithm for $\\tau=0$ and exponential convergence for $\\tau>0$. The results\napply to common regularisers including relative entropy, $\\chi^2$-divergence,\nand entropic Wasserstein costs. This validates recent reinforcement learning\nheuristics that adding regularisation accelerates the convergence of gradient\nmethods. The proof exploits careful regularity estimates of backward stochastic\ndifferential equations in the bounded mean oscillation norm.",

                "summary": "Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples\nagainst Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on\nincreasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on\none-hot encoding settings. In this paper, we propose a more general,\ntheoretically sound, targeted attack that resorts to the minimization of a\nJacobian-induced MAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, taking into account the\neffort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of\nthe input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting\nthe Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a\nNon-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm provides an\noptimal solution to a linearized version of the adversarial example problem\noriginally introduced by Szegedy et al. \\cite{szegedy2013intriguing}. The\nexperiments we carried out confirm the generality of the proposed attack which\nis proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes.\nNoticeably, the JMA attack is also effective in a multi-label classification\nscenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the\nlabels in a complex multilabel classification scenario with 20 labels, a\ncapability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a\nfurther advantage, the JMA attack usually requires very few iterations, thus\nresulting more efficient than existing methods.",

                "summary": "Skin lesions are classified in benign or malignant. Among the malignant,\nmelanoma is a very aggressive cancer and the major cause of deaths. So, early\ndiagnosis of skin cancer is very desired. In the last few years, there is a\ngrowing interest in computer aided diagnostic (CAD) using most image and\nclinical data of the lesion. These sources of information present limitations\ndue to their inability to provide information of the molecular structure of the\nlesion. NIR spectroscopy may provide an alternative source of information to\nautomated CAD of skin lesions. The most commonly used techniques and\nclassification algorithms used in spectroscopy are Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and Support\nVector Machines (SVM). Nonetheless, there is a growing interest in applying the\nmodern techniques of machine and deep learning (MDL) to spectroscopy. One of\nthe main limitations to apply MDL to spectroscopy is the lack of public\ndatasets. Since there is no public dataset of NIR spectral data to skin\nlesions, as far as we know, an effort has been made and a new dataset named\nNIR-SC-UFES, has been collected, annotated and analyzed generating the\ngold-standard for classification of NIR spectral data to skin cancer. Next, the\nmachine learning algorithms XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, 1D-convolutional\nneural network (1D-CNN) were investigated to classify cancer and non-cancer\nskin lesions. Experimental results indicate the best performance obtained by\nLightGBM with pre-processing using standard normal variate (SNV), feature\nextraction providing values of 0.839 for balanced accuracy, 0.851 for recall,\n0.852 for precision, and 0.850 for F-score. The obtained results indicate the\nfirst steps in CAD of skin lesions aiming the automated triage of patients with\nskin lesions in vivo using NIR spectral data.",

                "summary": "The current approach to fetal anomaly screening is based on biometric\nmeasurements derived from individually selected ultrasound images. In this\npaper, we introduce a paradigm shift that attains human-level performance in\nbiometric measurement by aggregating automatically extracted biometrics from\nevery frame across an entire scan, with no need for operator intervention. We\nuse a convolutional neural network to classify each frame of an ultrasound\nvideo recording. We then measure fetal biometrics in every frame where\nappropriate anatomy is visible. We use a Bayesian method to estimate the true\nvalue of each biometric from a large number of measurements and\nprobabilistically reject outliers. We performed a retrospective experiment on\n1457 recordings (comprising 48 million frames) of 20-week ultrasound scans,\nestimated fetal biometrics in those scans and compared our estimates to the\nmeasurements sonographers took during the scan. Our method achieves human-level\nperformance in estimating fetal biometrics and estimates well-calibrated\ncredible intervals in which the true biometric value is expected to lie.",

It begins with a Keplerian integrals method\nthat allows us to link two tracklets, computing preliminary orbits, even when\nthe tracklets are separated in time by a few years. In the second step, we\nrepresent the results in a `graph' where the tracklets are the nodes and the\npreliminary orbits are the edges. Then, acceptable `3-cycles' are identified\nand a least squares orbit is computed for each of them. Finally, we construct\nsequences of $n \\geq 4$ tracklets by searching through the orbits of nearby\n3-cycles and attempting to attribute the remaining tracklets. We calculate the\ntechnique's efficiency at identifying unknown objects using real detections\nthat attempt to mimic key parameters of the Minor Planet Center's Isolated\nTracklet File (ITF) and then apply the procedure to the ITF to identify tens of\nthousands of new objects.",

                "summary": "Recently, two monolayer magnetic materials, i.e., FePS3 and NiPS3, have been\nsuccessfully fabricated. Despite that they have the same atomic structure, the\ntwo monolayers exhibit distinct magnetic properties. FePS3 holds an\nout-of-plane zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM-ZZ) structure, while NiPS3 exhibits\nan in-plane AFM-ZZ structure. However, there is no theoretical model which can\nproperly describe its magnetic ground state due to the lack of a full\nunderstanding of its magnetic interactions. Here, by combining the\nfirst-principles calculations and the newly developed machine learning method,\nwe construct an exact spin Hamiltonian of the two magnetic materials. Different\nfrom the previous studies which failed to fully consider the spin-orbit\ncoupling effect, we find that the AFM-ZZ ground state in FePS3 is stabilized by\ncompeting ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic third\nnearest-neighbor exchange interactions, and combining single-ion anisotropy.\nWhereas, the often ignored nearest-neighbor biquadratic exchange is responsible\nfor the in-plane AFM-ZZ ground state in NiPS3. We additionally calculate\nspin-wave spectrum of AFM-ZZ structure in the two monolayers based on the exact\nspin Hamiltonian, which can be directly verified by the experimental\ninvestigation. Our work provides a theoretical framework for the origin of\nAFM-ZZ ground state in two-dimensional materials.",

                "summary": "With the rapid development of machine learning and a growing concern for data\nprivacy, federated learning has become a focal point of attention. However,\nattacks on model parameters and a lack of incentive mechanisms hinder the\neffectiveness of federated learning. Therefore, we propose A Privacy Protected\nBlockchain-based Federated Learning Model (PPBFL) to enhance the security of\nfederated learning and encourage active participation of nodes in model\ntraining. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity of model parameters\nstored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), providing protection against\ntampering. Within the blockchain, we introduce a Proof of Training Work (PoTW)\nconsensus algorithm tailored for federated learning, aiming to incentive\ntraining nodes. This algorithm rewards nodes with greater computational power,\npromoting increased participation and effort in the federated learning process.\nA novel adaptive differential privacy algorithm is simultaneously applied to\nlocal and global models. This safeguards the privacy of local data at training\nclients, preventing malicious nodes from launching inference attacks.\nAdditionally, it enhances the security of the global model, preventing\npotential security degradation resulting from the combination of numerous local\nmodels. The possibility of security degradation is derived from the composition\ntheorem. By introducing reverse noise in the global model, a zero-bias estimate\nof differential privacy noise between local and global models is achieved.\nFurthermore, we propose a new mix transactions mechanism utilizing ring\nsignature technology to better protect the identity privacy of local training\nclients. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that PPBFL,\ncompared to baseline methods, not only exhibits superior model performance but\nalso achieves higher security.",

By incorporating a\nlimited set of experimental room impulse responses as training data, this\napproach combines neural network processing capabilities with the underlying\nphysics of sound propagation, as articulated by the wave equation. The\nnetwork's ability to estimate particle velocity and intensity, in addition to\nsound pressure, demonstrates its capacity to represent the flow of acoustic\nenergy and completely characterise the sound field with only a few\nmeasurements. Additionally, an investigation into the potential of this network\nas a tool for improving acoustic simulations is conducted. This is due to its\nprofficiency in offering grid-free sound field mappings with minimal inference\ntime. Furthermore, a study is carried out which encompasses comparative\nanalyses against current approaches for sound field reconstruction.\nSpecifically, the proposed approach is evaluated against both data-driven\ntechniques and elementary wave-based regression methods. The results\ndemonstrate that the physics-informed neural network stands out when\nreconstructing the early part of the room impulse response, while\nsimultaneously allowing for complete sound field characterisation in the time\ndomain.",

This paper introduces our\nefforts towards personalized face generation. To this end, we propose a novel\nmulti-modal face generation framework, capable of simultaneous\nidentity-expression control and more fine-grained expression synthesis. Our\nexpression control is so sophisticated that it can be specialized by the\nfine-grained emotional vocabulary. We devise a novel diffusion model that can\nundertake the task of simultaneously face swapping and reenactment. Due to the\nentanglement of identity and expression, it's nontrivial to separately and\nprecisely control them in one framework, thus has not been explored yet. To\novercome this, we propose several innovative designs in the conditional\ndiffusion model, including balancing identity and expression encoder, improved\nmidpoint sampling, and explicitly background conditioning. Extensive\nexperiments have demonstrated the controllability and scalability of the\nproposed framework, in comparison with state-of-the-art text-to-image, face\nswapping, and face reenactment methods.",

                "summary": "Crowd counting has gained significant popularity due to its practical\napplications. However, mainstream counting methods ignore precise individual\nlocalization and suffer from annotation noise because of counting from\nestimating density maps. Additionally, they also struggle with high-density\nimages.To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end model called\nFine-Grained Extraction Network (FGENet). Different from methods estimating\ndensity maps, FGENet directly learns the original coordinate points that\nrepresent the precise localization of individuals.This study designs a fusion\nmodule, named Fine-Grained Feature Pyramid(FGFP), that is used to fuse feature\nmaps extracted by the backbone of FGENet. The fused features are then passed to\nboth regression and classification heads, where the former provides predicted\npoint coordinates for a given image, and the latter determines the confidence\nlevel for each predicted point being an individual. At the end, FGENet\nestablishes correspondences between prediction points and ground truth points\nby employing the Hungarian algorithm. For training FGENet, we design a robust\nloss function, named Three-Task Combination (TTC), to mitigate the impact of\nannotation noise. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used crowd\ncounting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nFGENet. Notably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of 3.14 points in\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) on the ShanghaiTech Part A dataset, showcasing its\nsuperiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Even more impressively,\nFGENet surpasses previous benchmarks on the UCF\\_CC\\_50 dataset with an\nastounding enhancement of 30.16 points in MAE.",

To the pair $(U,f)$ one can associate an\ninfinite cyclic cover $U^f$, and (homology) Alexander modules are defined as\nthe homology groups of this cover. In two recent works, the first of which is\njoint with Geske, Maxim and Wang, we developed two different ways to put a\nmixed Hodge structure on Alexander modules. Since they are not finite\ndimensional in general, each approach replaces the Alexander module by a\ndifferent finite dimensional module: one of them takes the torsion submodule,\nthe other takes finite dimensional quotients, and the constructions are not\ndirectly comparable. In this note, we show that both constructions are\ncompatible, in the sense that the map from the torsion to the quotients is a\nmixed Hodge structure morphism.",

These methods are based on the conservation laws of\nKepler's problem, and enable the linkage of very short arcs of optical\nobservations even when they are separated in time by a few years. Our analysis\nis performed using both synthetic and real data of 822 main belt asteroids. The\ndifferences between computed and true orbital elements have been analysed for\nthe true linkages, as well as the occurrence of alternative solutions. Some\nmetrics have been introduced to quantify the results, with the aim of\ndiscarding as many of the false linkages as possible and keeping the vast\nmajority of true ones. These numerical experiments provide thresholds for the\nmetrics which take advantage of the knowledge of the \\emph{ground truth}: the\nvalues of these thresholds can be used in normal operation mode, when we do not\nknow the correct values of the orbital elements and whether the linkages are\ntrue or false.",

                "summary": "As more IoT applications gradually move towards the cloud-edge collaborative\nmode, the containerized scheduling of workflows extends from the cloud to the\nedge. However, given the high delay of the communication network, loose\ncoupling of structure, and resource heterogeneity between cloud and edge,\nworkflow containerization scheduling in the cloud-edge scenarios faces the\ndifficulty of resource coordination and application collaboration management.\nTo address these two issues, we propose a KubeEdge-Cloud-Edge-Scheduling scheme\nnamed KCES, a workflow containerization scheduling scheme for the KubeEdge\ncloud-edge framework. The KCES includes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine\nfor KubeEdge and workflow scheduling strategies for task horizontal roaming and\nvertical offloading. Considering the scheduling optimization of cloud-edge\nworkflows, this paper proposes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling model and\ncloud-edge node model and designs a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine to\nmaximize cloud-edge resource utilization under the constraint of workflow task\ndelay. A cloud-edge resource hybrid management technology is used to design the\ncloud-edge resource evaluation and resource allocation algorithms to achieve\ncloud-edge resource collaboration. Based on the ideas of distributed functional\nroles and the hierarchical division of computing power, the horizontal roaming\namong the edges and vertical offloading strategies between the cloud and edges\nfor workflow tasks are designed to realize the cloud-edge application\ncollaboration. Through a customized IoT application workflow instance,\nexperimental results show that KCES is superior to the baseline in total\nworkflow duration, average workflow duration, and resource usage and has the\ncapabilities of horizontal roaming and vertical offloading for workflow tasks.",

                "summary": "Fine-tuning has been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve the\ndomain performance of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs might fit the\ndataset bias and shortcuts for prediction, leading to poor generation\nperformance. Previous works have proven that LLMs are prone to exhibit position\nbias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or\nspecific positional cues within the input. Existing debiasing methods for LLMs\nrequire external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples, which is\nlacking for position debiasing and impractical in reality. In this work, we\npropose a self-supervised position debiasing (SOD) framework to mitigate\nposition bias for LLMs. SOD leverages unsupervised responses from pre-trained\nLLMs for debiasing without relying on any external knowledge. To improve the\nquality of unsupervised responses, we propose an objective alignment (OAM)\nmodule to prune these responses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks\nshow that SOD consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating three\ntypes of position biases. Besides, SOD achieves this by sacrificing only a\nsmall performance on biased samples, which is general and effective. To\nfacilitate the reproducibility of the results, we share the code of all methods\nand datasets on https://github.com/LZKSKY/SOD.",

In this work, we challenge this setup\nand show that MTL can be successful with classification tasks with little, or\nnon-overlapping annotations, or when there is big discrepancy in the size of\nlabeled data per task. We explore task-relatedness for co-annotation and\nco-training, and propose a novel approach, where knowledge exchange is enabled\nbetween the tasks via distribution matching. To demonstrate the general\napplicability of our method, we conducted diverse case studies in the domains\nof affective computing, face recognition, species recognition, and shopping\nitem classification using nine datasets. Our large-scale study of affective\ntasks for basic expression recognition and facial action unit detection\nillustrates that our approach is network agnostic and brings large performance\nimprovements compared to the state-of-the-art in both tasks and across all\nstudied databases. In all case studies, we show that co-training via\ntask-relatedness is advantageous and prevents negative transfer (which occurs\nwhen MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task\nmodel).",

This paper introduces a\nnovel DeePODE method, which consists of a global multiscale sampling method and\na fitting by deep neural networks to handle multiscale systems. DeePODE's\nprimary contribution is to address the multiscale challenge of efficiently\nuncovering representative training sets by combining the Monte Carlo method and\nthe ODE system's intrinsic evolution without suffering from the ``curse of\ndimensionality''. The DeePODE method is validated in multiscale systems from\ndiverse areas, including a predator-prey model, a power system oscillation, a\nbattery electrolyte auto-ignition, and turbulent flames. Our methods exhibit\nstrong generalization capabilities to unseen conditions, highlighting the power\nof deep learning in modeling intricate multiscale dynamical processes across\nscience and engineering domains.",

                "summary": "We study the emission of dust grains within the Orion Bar - a well-known,\nhighly far-UV (FUV)-irradiated PDR. The Orion Bar because of its edge-on\ngeometry provides an exceptional benchmark for characterizing dust evolution\nand the associated driving processes under varying physical conditions. Our\ngoal is to constrain the local properties of dust by comparing its emission to\nmodels. Taking advantage of the recent JWST PDRs4All data, we follow the dust\nemission as traced by JWST NIRCam (at 3.35 and 4.8 micron) and MIRI (at 7.7,\n11.3, 15.0, and 25.5 micron), along with NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic\nobservations. First, we constrain the minimum size and hydrogen content of\ncarbon nano-grains from a comparison between the observed dust emission spectra\nand the predictions of the THEMIS dust model coupled to the numerical code\nDustEM. Using this dust model, we then perform 3D radiative transfer\nsimulations of dust emission with the SOC code and compare to data obtained\nalong well chosen profiles across the Orion Bar. The JWST data allows us, for\nthe first time, to spatially resolve the steep variation of dust emission at\nthe illuminated edge of the Orion Bar PDR. By considering a dust model with\ncarbonaceous nano-grains and submicronic coated silicate grains, we derive\nunprecedented constraints on the properties of across the Orion Bar. To explain\nthe observed emission profiles with our simulations, we find that the\nnano-grains must be strongly depleted with an abundance (relative to the gas)\n15 times less than in the diffuse ISM. The NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic\nobservations reveal variations in the hydrogenation of the carbon nano-grains.\nThe lowest hydrogenation levels are found in the vicinity of the illuminating\nstars suggesting photo-processing while more hydrogenated nano-grains are found\nin the cold and dense molecular region, potentially indicative of larger\ngrains.",

Due to the same symmetry of the band-edge states, the\ntwo-dimensional polarization $\\alpha_{2D}$ would be finite as the band gap goes\nto zero, allowing for an EI state in the compound. Using the first-principles\nmany-body perturbation theory, the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation calculation\nreveals that the exciton binding energy is larger than the single-particle band\ngap, indicating the excitonic instability. The computed phonon spectrum\nsuggests that the monolayer is dynamically stable without lattice distortion.\nOur findings suggest that the Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator\nwithout structural distortion.",

In addition, the\ndirectionality of deformation twinning is also verified. We investigated\ntwinning in FCC crystals to illustrate the methodology, and predicted the CRSS\nof twinning under different variables such as temperature and strain rate, both\nof which were in excellent agreement with experimental and other theory\nresults. It draws the conclusion that we can promote twinning nucleation by\napplying shear stress along the <112> direction to reduce the interface energy\nas a resistance term and increase the difference in strain energy for twinning\nnucleation. This conclusion provides a guiding direction for exploring and\naccurately predicting the conditions of twinning in FCC crystals in future.",

Of most interest are the\nso-called jammed states, where no more houses can be built without violating\nthe condition that every house needs to have free space to at least one of its\nsides. In this paper, we introduce new agents (predators and altruists) that\nwant to build houses once the settlement is already in the jammed state. Their\nbehavior is governed by a different set of rules, and this allows them to build\nnew houses even though the settlement is jammed. Our main focus is to detect\njammed configurations that are resistant to predators, to altruists, and to\nboth predators and altruists. We provide bivariate generating functions, and\ncomplexity functions (configurational entropies) for such jammed\nconfigurations. We also discuss this problem in the two-dimensional setting of\na combinatorial settlement planning model that was also recently introduced by\nthe authors, and of which the Riviera model is just a special case.",

To fully exploit this potential, the interrelated\nproblems of modelling radiative transport and the dynamical structure of the\naccretion flow must, however, be solved. This task is challenging both from a\ntheoretical and observational point of view and is further complicated by a\nlack of direct correspondence between the properties of emission emerging from\nthe neutron star and observed far away from it. In general, a mixture of\nemission from both poles of the neutron star viewed from different angles is\nindeed observed at some or even all phases of the pulse cycle. It is essential,\ntherefore, to reconstruct the contributions of each pole to the observed flux\nin order to test and refine models describing the formation of the spectra and\npulse profiles of X-ray pulsars. In this paper we propose a novel data-driven\napproach to address this problem using the pulse-to-pulse variability in the\nobserved flux, and demonstrate its application to RXTE observations of the\nbright persistent X-ray pulsar Cen X-3. We then discuss the comparison of our\nresults with previous work attempting to solve the same problem and how they\ncan be qualitatively interpreted in the framework of a toy model describing\nemission from the poles of a neutron star.",

                "summary": "The development of facial biometric systems has contributed greatly to the\ndevelopment of the computer vision field. Nowadays, there's always a need to\ndevelop a multimodal system that combines multiple biometric traits in an\nefficient, meaningful way. In this paper, we introduce \"IdentiFace\" which is a\nmultimodal facial biometric system that combines the core of facial recognition\nwith some of the most important soft biometric traits such as gender, face\nshape, and emotion. We also focused on developing the system using only VGG-16\ninspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems. This\nunification allows for simpler integration across modalities. It makes it\neasier to interpret the learned features between the tasks which gives a good\nindication about the decision-making process across the facial modalities and\npotential connection. For the recognition problem, we acquired a 99.2% test\naccuracy for five classes with high intra-class variations using data collected\nfrom the FERET database[1]. We achieved 99.4% on our dataset and 95.15% on the\npublic dataset[2] in the gender recognition problem. We were also able to\nachieve a testing accuracy of 88.03% in the face-shape problem using the\ncelebrity face-shape dataset[3]. Finally, we achieved a decent testing accuracy\nof 66.13% in the emotion task which is considered a very acceptable accuracy\ncompared to related work on the FER2013 dataset[4].",

                "summary": "Homodyne measurement is a crucial tool widely used to address continuous\nvariables for bosonic quantum systems. While an ideal homodyne detection\nprovides a powerful analysis, e.g. to effectively measure quadrature amplitudes\nof light in quantum optics, it relies on the use of a strong reference field,\nthe so-called local oscillator typically in a coherent state. Such a strong\ncoherent local oscillator may not be readily available particularly for a\nmassive quantum system like Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), posing a\nsubstantial challenge in dealing with continuous variables appropriately. It is\nnecessary to establish a practical framework that includes the effects of\nnon-ideal local oscillators for a rigorous assessment of various quantum tests\nand applications. We here develop entanglement criteria beyond Gaussian regime\napplicable for this realistic homodyne measurement that do not require\nassumptions on the state of local oscillators. We discuss the working\nconditions of homodyne detection to effectively detect non-Gaussian quantum\nentanglement under various states of local oscillators.",

                "summary": "The NASA New Horizons Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (SDC) measures dust\nparticle impacts along the spacecraft's flight path for grains with mass $\\ge$\n$10^{-12}$ g, mapping out their spatial density distribution. We present the\nlatest SDC dust density, size distribution, and flux measurements through 55 au\nand compare them to numerical model predictions. Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are\nthought to be the dominant source of interplanetary dust particles (IDP) in the\nouter solar system due to both collisions between KBOs, and their continual\nbombardment by interstellar dust particles (ISD).\n  Continued measurements through 55 au show higher than model-predicted dust\nfluxes as New Horizons approaches the putative outer edge of the Kuiper Belt\n(KB). We discuss potential explanations for the growing deviation: radiation\npressure stretches the dust distribution to further heliocentric distances than\nits parent body distribution; icy dust grains undergo photo-sputtering that\nrapidly increases their response to radiation pressure forces and pushes them\nfurther away from the sun; and the distribution of KBOs may extend much further\nthan existing observations suggest. Ongoing SDC measurements at even larger\nheliocentric distances will continue to constrain the contributions of dust\nproduction in the KB. Continued SDC measurements remain crucial for\nunderstanding the Kuiper Belt and the interpretation of observations of dust\ndisks around other stars.",

                "summary": "We develop a Bayesian modeling framework to address a pressing real-life\nproblem faced by the police in tackling insurgent gangs. Unlike criminals\nassociated with common crimes such as robbery, theft or street crime, insurgent\ngangs are trained in sophisticated arms and strategise against the government\nto weaken its resolve. They are constantly on the move, operating over large\nareas causing damage to national properties and terrorizing ordinary citizens.\nDifferent from the more commonly addressed problem of modeling crime-events,\nour context requires that an approach be formulated to model the movement of\ninsurgent gangs, which is more valuable to the police forces in preempting\ntheir activities and nabbing them. This paper evolved as a collaborative work\nwith the Indian police to help augment their tactics with a systematic method,\nby integrating past data on observed gang-locations with the expert knowledge\nof the police officers. A methodological challenge in modeling the movement of\ninsurgent gangs is that the data on their locations is incomplete, since they\nare observable only at some irregularly separated time-points. Based on a\nweighted kernel density formulation for temporal data, we analytically derive\nthe closed form of the likelihood, conditional on incomplete past observed\ndata. Building on the current tactics used by the police, we device an approach\nfor constructing an expert-prior on gang-locations, along with a sequential\nBayesian procedure for estimation and prediction. We also propose a new metric\nfor predictive assessment that complements another known metric used in similar\nproblems.",

In recent years,\nRiemannian graph representation learning has emerged as an exciting alternative\nto Euclidean ones. However, Riemannian methods are still in an early stage:\nmost of them present a single curvature (radius) regardless of structural\ncomplexity, suffer from numerical instability due to the\nexponential/logarithmic map, and lack the ability to capture motif regularity.\nIn light of the issues above, we propose the problem of \\emph{Motif-aware\nRiemannian Graph Representation Learning}, seeking a numerically stable encoder\nto capture motif regularity in a diverse-curvature manifold without labels. To\nthis end, we present a novel Motif-aware Riemannian model with\nGenerative-Contrastive learning (MotifRGC), which conducts a minmax game in\nRiemannian manifold in a self-supervised manner. First, we propose a new type\nof Riemannian GCN (D-GCN), in which we construct a diverse-curvature manifold\nby a product layer with the diversified factor, and replace the\nexponential/logarithmic map by a stable kernel layer. Second, we introduce a\nmotif-aware Riemannian generative-contrastive learning to capture motif\nregularity in the constructed manifold and learn motif-aware node\nrepresentation without external labels. Empirical results show the superiority\nof MofitRGC.",

This propagation leads to an exponential\ngrowth of a node's current representation at every propagation step, making it\nextremely challenging to capture valuable dependencies between long-distance\nnodes. To address this issue, we introduce Graph Elimination Networks (GENs),\nwhich employ a specific algorithm to eliminate redundancies during neighborhood\npropagation.

                "summary": "The notions of predictability and visibility are essential in the\nmathematical formulation of wave particle duality. The work of Jakob and Bergou\n[Phys. Rev. A 76, 052107] generalises these notions for higher-dimensional\nquantum systems, which were initially defined for qubits, and subsequently\nproves a complementarity relation between predictability and visibility. By\ndefining the single-party information content of a quantum system as the\naddition of predictability and visibility, and assuming that entanglement in a\nbipartite system in the form of concurrence mutually excludes the single-party\ninformation, the authors have proposed a complementarity relation between the\nconcurrence and the single-party information content. We show that the\ninformation content of a quantum system defined by Jakob and Bergou is nothing\nbut the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the state of the quantum system of our\nconsideration and the maximally mixed state. Motivated by the fact that the\ntrace distance is a good measure of distance as compared to the Hilbert-Schmidt\ndistance from the information theoretic point of view, we, in this work, define\nthe information content of a quantum system as the trace distance between the\nquantum state and the maximally mixed state. We then employ the quantum\nPinsker's inequality and the reverse Pinsker's inequality to derive a new\ncomplementarity and a reverse complementarity relation between the single-party\ninformation content and the entanglement present in a bipartite quantum system\nin a pure state. As a consequence of our findings, we show that for a bipartite\nsystem in a pure state, its entanglement and the predictabilities and\nvisibilities associated with the subsystems cannot be arbitrarily small as well\nas arbitrarily large.",

In this work, we analyze various levels of\nincompatibility of measurement sets. We provide operational classification of\nmeasurement incompatibility with respect to two elementary classical\noperations, viz., coarse-graining of measurement outcomes and convex mixing of\ndifferent measurements. We derive analytical criteria for determining when a\nset of projective measurements is fully incompatible with respect to\ncoarse-graining or convex mixing. Robustness against white noise is\ninvestigated for mutually unbiased bases that can sustain full incompatibility.\nFurthermore, we propose operational witnesses for different levels of\nincompatibility subject to classical operations, using the input-output\nstatistics of Bell-type experiments as well as experiments in the\nprepare-and-measure scenario.",

We prove that it is the\nsame as $n(H,g)$ up to a multiplicative constant. ii) The smallest size girth\n$g$ graph with a prescribed degree distribution.

This article introduces some basic tools to investigate this\nissue. To consider ensembles of more physical finite velocity trajectories, we\ncan work in $(x,v)$ phase space like in Langevin equation with velocity\ncontrolling spatial steps, here also controlled with spatial potential $V(x)$.\nThere are derived and compared 4 approaches to predict stationary probability\ndistributions: using Boltzmann ensemble of steps/points in space (GRW - generic\nrandom walk) or in phase space (psGRW), and analogously Boltzmann ensemble of\npaths in space (MERW - maximal entropy random walk) and in phase space\n(psMERW), also generalized to L{\\'e}vy flights. Path ensembles generally have\nmuch stronger Anderson-like localization, MERW has stationary distribution\nexactly as quantum ground state. Proposed novel MERW in phase space has some\nslight differences, which might be distinguished experimentally.

                "summary": "Accurate determination of mass-loss rates from massive stars is important to\nunderstanding stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar\nmedium. Large-scale structure and variability in stellar winds have significant\neffects on mass-loss rates. Time-series observations provide direct\nquantification of such variability. Observations of this nature are available\nfor some Galactic early supergiant stars but not yet for stars in lower\nmetallicity environments such as the Magellanic Clouds. We utilise ultraviolet\nspectra from the Hubble Space Telescope ULLYSES program to demonstrate that the\npresence of structure in stellar winds of supergiant stars at low metallicities\nmay be discerned from single-epoch spectra. We find evidence that, for given\nstellar luminosities and mean stellar wind optical depths, structure is more\nprevalent at higher metallicities. We confirm, at Large Magellanic Cloud (0.5\nZ_solar), Small Magellanic Cloud (0.2 Z_solar) and lower (0.14 -- 0.1 Z_solar)\nmetallicities, earlier Galactic results that there does not appear to be\ncorrelation between the degree of structure in stellar winds of massive stars\nand stellar effective temperature. Similar lack of correlation is found with\nregard to terminal velocity of stellar winds. Additional and revised values for\nradial velocities of stars and terminal velocities of stellar winds are\npresented. Direct evidence of temporal variability, on timescales of several\ndays, in stellar wind at low metallicity is found. We illustrate that narrow\nabsorption components in wind-formed profiles of Galactic OB stellar spectra\nremain common in early B supergiant spectra at low metallicities, providing\nmeans for better constraining hot, massive star mass-loss rates.",

Herein, inferring future interaction is\nof fundamental importance, and previous efforts are mainly focused on the\ndynamics in the classic zero-curvature Euclidean space. Despite the promising\nresults achieved by previous methods, a range of significant issues still\nlargely remains open: On the bipartite nature, is it appropriate to place user\nand item nodes in one identical space regardless of their inherent difference?\nOn the network dynamics, instead of a fixed curvature space, will the\nrepresentation spaces evolve when new interactions arrive continuously? On the\nlearning paradigm, can we get rid of the label information costly to acquire?\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel Contrastive model for\nSequential Interaction Network learning on Co-Evolving RiEmannian spaces,\nCSINCERE. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a couple\nof co-evolving representation spaces, rather than a single or static space, and\npropose a co-contrastive learning for the sequential interaction network. In\nCSINCERE, we formulate a Cross-Space Aggregation for message-passing across\nrepresentation spaces of different Riemannian geometries, and design a Neural\nCurvature Estimator based on Ricci curvatures for modeling the space evolvement\nover time. Thereafter, we present a Reweighed Co-Contrast between the temporal\nviews of the sequential network, so that the couple of Riemannian spaces\ninteract with each other for the interaction prediction without labels.\nEmpirical results on 5 public datasets show the superiority of CSINCERE over\nthe state-of-the-art methods.",

                "summary": "RGBT tracking has been widely used in various fields such as robotics,\nsurveillance processing, and autonomous driving. Existing RGBT trackers fully\nexplore the spatial information between the template and the search region and\nlocate the target based on the appearance matching results. However, these RGBT\ntrackers have very limited exploitation of temporal information, either\nignoring temporal information or exploiting it through online sampling and\ntraining. The former struggles to cope with the object state changes, while the\nlatter neglects the correlation between spatial and temporal information. To\nalleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Adaptive RGBT Tracking\nframework, named as TATrack. TATrack has a spatio-temporal two-stream structure\nand captures temporal information by an online updated template, where the\ntwo-stream structure refers to the multi-modal feature extraction and\ncross-modal interaction for the initial template and the online update template\nrespectively. TATrack contributes to comprehensively exploit spatio-temporal\ninformation and multi-modal information for target localization. In addition,\nwe design a spatio-temporal interaction (STI) mechanism that bridges two\nbranches and enables cross-modal interaction to span longer time scales.\nExtensive experiments on three popular RGBT tracking benchmarks show that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance, while running at real-time speed.",

Relying solely\non numerical approaches often obscures the intricate interplay and influence of\nthe individual terms within the equation.

In this study, we address these\nchallenges by leveraging our recently published updated Fraunhofer diffraction\nexpression. This approach allows us to derive an analytic solution for\ncomplex-valued phase disks in on-axis holography. This solution facilitates the\ndirect computation of each term's influence within the holographic equation,\npaving the way for a more profound comprehension and application of the\nholographic process. When compared to experimental results and the numeric\nFresnel diffraction solution, our analytic approach shows impressive accuracy,\nconsidering the inherent approximations.

We prove upper and lower bounds on the\nresulting ground state energy estimates, and the error associated to the upper\nbound is linear in the input error rates. This resolves a misalignment between\nknown numerics, which exhibit approximately linear error scaling, and prior\ntheoretical analysis, which only provably obtained scaling with the error rate\nto the power $\\frac{2}{3}$. Our main technique is to express generic errors in\nterms of an effective target Hamiltonian studied in an effective Krylov space.\nThese results provide a theoretical framework for understanding the main\nfeatures of quantum Krylov errors.",

The use of artificial\nintelligence techniques such as machine learning, computer vision and deep\nlearning are promising solutions to help identify and classify diseases in\ncocoa pods. In this paper we introduce the development and evaluation of a deep\nlearning computational model applied to the identification of diseases in cocoa\npods, focusing on \"monilia\" and \"black pod\" diseases. An exhaustive review of\nstate-of-the-art of computational models was carried out, based on scientific\narticles related to the identification of plant diseases using computer vision\nand deep learning techniques. As a result of the search, EfficientDet-Lite4, an\nefficient and lightweight model for object detection, was selected. A dataset,\nincluding images of both healthy and diseased cocoa pods, has been utilized to\ntrain the model to detect and pinpoint disease manifestations with considerable\naccuracy. Significant enhancements in the model training and evaluation\ndemonstrate the capability of recognizing and classifying diseases through\nimage analysis. Furthermore, the functionalities of the model were integrated\ninto an Android native mobile with an user-friendly interface, allowing to\nyounger or inexperienced farmers a fast and accuracy identification of health\nstatus of cocoa pods",

As case of study, we investigate the\nconsequences on the homology of multipath complexes; eg. on its torsion.\nFurther, we prove a comparison result: we show that, when restricted to\ndirected graphs without oriented cycles, multipath complexes and matching\ncomplexes yield functors which commute up to a blow-up operation on directed\ngraphs. We use this fact to compute the homotopy type of matching complexes for\na certain class of bipartite graphs also known as half-graphs or ladders. We\ncomplement the work with a study of the (representation) category of cones, and\nwith analysing related consequences on magnitude cohomology of quivers.",

Here, we focus on cold atomic gases in optical lattices and\npropose a novel driving scheme that breaks rotation symmetry but maintains\ninversion symmetry of the instantaneous Hamiltonian, and discover a novel type\nof anomalous Floquet topological phase with winding number larger than 1. By\nanalyzing the condition of band touching under symmetry constraint, we map out\nthe phase diagram exactly by varying the driving parameters and discuss the\nquasienergy spectra of typical topological phases, which can present multiple\npairs of edge modes within a single gap. Finally, we suggest to characterize\nthe topology of such phases by detecting the band inversion surfaces via quench\ndynamics.",

Three impurity levels that\narise from intervalley scattering are found above the valence band maxima\n(VBM): an orbitally doubly degenerate $e'$ level bound to the $K/K'$ VBM and a\nsingly degenerate $a'_1$ level bound to the $\\Gamma$-point VBM. Replacing S\nwith Se or Te lowers the $\\Gamma$ point VBM substantially with respect to the\n$K/K'$ VBM bringing the $a'_1$ level down with it. The relative positions of\nthe impurity levels that determine the different structural and electronic\nproperties of the impurities in $p$-doped MX$_2$ monolayers can thus be tuned\nby replacing S with Se or Te.\n  Single acceptors introduce a magnetic moment of 1$\\, \\mu_{\\rm B}$ in all\nMX$_2$ monolayers. Out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy energies as large as 10\nmeV/dopant atom are found thereby satisfying an essential condition for\nlong-range ferromagnetic ordering in two dimensions. For double acceptors in\nMS$_2$ monolayers, both holes occupy the high-lying $a'_1$ level with opposite\nspins so there is no magnetic moment; in MSe$_2$ and MTe$_2$ monolayers the\nholes occupy the $e'$ level, a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion wins the competition\nwith exchange splitting resulting in the quenching of the magnetic moments.\nEven when the JT distortion is disallowed, magnetic double acceptors have a\nlarge in-plane magnetic anisotropy energy that is incompatible with long-range\nmagnetic ordering in two dimensions. ....",

                "summary": "From politicians to podcast hosts, online platforms have systematically\nbanned (``deplatformed'') influential users for breaking platform guidelines.\nPrevious inquiries on the effectiveness of this intervention are inconclusive\nbecause 1) they consider only few deplatforming events; 2) they consider only\novert engagement traces (e.g., likes and posts) but not passive engagement\n(e.g., views); 3) they do not consider all the potential places users impacted\nby the deplatforming event might migrate to. We address these limitations in a\nlongitudinal, quasi-experimental study of 165 deplatforming events targeted at\n101 influencers. We collect deplatforming events from Reddit posts and then\nmanually curate the data, ensuring the correctness of a large dataset of\ndeplatforming events. Then, we link these events to Google Trends and Wikipedia\npage views, platform-agnostic measures of online attention that capture the\ngeneral public's interest in specific influencers. Through a\ndifference-in-differences approach, we find that deplatforming reduces online\nattention toward influencers. After 12 months, we estimate that online\nattention toward deplatformed influencers is reduced by -63% (95% CI\n[-75%,-46%]) on Google and by -43% (95% CI [-57%,-24%]) on Wikipedia. Further,\nas we study over a hundred deplatforming events, we can analyze in which cases\ndeplatforming is more or less impactful, revealing nuances about the\nintervention. Notably, we find that both permanent and temporary deplatforming\nreduce online attention toward influencers; Overall, this work contributes to\nthe ongoing effort to map the effectiveness of content moderation\ninterventions, driving platform governance away from speculation.",

For small values of the parameter, the solution reduces to the\nlinear perturbation of AdS$_5\\times S^5$ dual to the chiral primary operator in\nthe stress-tensor multiplet, and we give evidence that the geometry is regular\nand asymptotes AdS in a normalisable way for arbitrarily large values of the\nparameter. We conjecture that the solution is the gravity dual of a ``heavy\"\nmulti-trace operator in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(N)$ Super Yang-Mills made by $p$\ncopies of the stress-tensor chiral primary operator, with $p$ of order $N^2$ in\nthe large $N$ limit.

                "summary": "In this paper, we examine the parameter estimation performance of three\nwell-known sinusoidal models for speech and audio. The first one is the\nstandard Sinusoidal Model (SM), which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT). The second is the Exponentially Damped Sinusoidal Model (EDSM) which has\nbeen proposed in the last decade, and utilizes a subspace method for parameter\nestimation, and finally the extended adaptive Quasi-Harmonic Model (eaQHM),\nwhich has been recently proposed for AM-FM decomposition, and estimates the\nsignal parameters using Least Squares on a set of basis function that are\nadaptive to the local characteristics of the signal. The parameter estimation\nof each model is briefly described and its performance is compared to the\nothers in terms of signal reconstruction accuracy versus window size on a\nvariety of synthetic signals and versus the number of sinusoids on real\nsignals. The latter include highly non stationary signals, such as singing\nvoices and guitar solos. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are\npresented via synthetic signals and then the application on real signals is\ndiscussed. Conclusively, eaQHM outperforms EDS in medium-to-large window size\nanalysis, whereas EDSM yields higher reconstruction values for smaller analysis\nwindow sizes. Thus, a future research direction appears to be the merge of\nadaptivity of the eaQHM and parameter estimation robustness of the EDSM in a\nnew paradigm for high-quality analysis and resynthesis of general audio\nsignals.",

                "summary": "The recent innovations and breakthroughs in diffusion models have\nsignificantly expanded the possibilities of generating high-quality videos for\nthe given prompts. Most existing works tackle the single-scene scenario with\nonly one video event occurring in a single background. Extending to generate\nmulti-scene videos nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to nicely\nmanage the logic in between while preserving the consistent visual appearance\nof key content across video scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework, namely VideoStudio, for consistent-content and multi-scene video\ngeneration. Technically, VideoStudio leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to\nconvert the input prompt into comprehensive multi-scene script that benefits\nfrom the logical knowledge learnt by LLM. The script for each scene includes a\nprompt describing the event, the foreground/background entities, as well as\ncamera movement. VideoStudio identifies the common entities throughout the\nscript and asks LLM to detail each entity. The resultant entity description is\nthen fed into a text-to-image model to generate a reference image for each\nentity. Finally, VideoStudio outputs a multi-scene video by generating each\nscene video via a diffusion process that takes the reference images, the\ndescriptive prompt of the event and camera movement into account. The diffusion\nmodel incorporates the reference images as the condition and alignment to\nstrengthen the content consistency of multi-scene videos. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that VideoStudio outperforms the SOTA video generation models in\nterms of visual quality, content consistency, and user preference.

We\nadded interactive quizzes to The Rust Programming Language, the official\ntextbook for learning Rust. Over 13 months, 62,526 readers answered questions\n1,140,202 times. First, we analyze the trajectories of readers. We find that\nmany readers drop-out of the book early when faced with difficult language\nconcepts like Rust's ownership types. Second, we use classical test theory and\nitem response theory to analyze the characteristics of quiz questions. We find\nthat better questions are more conceptual in nature, such as asking why a\nprogram does not compile vs. whether a program compiles. Third, we performed 12\ninterventions into the book to help readers with difficult questions. We find\nthat on average, interventions improved quiz scores on the targeted questions\nby +20%. Fourth, we show that our technique can likely generalize to languages\nwith smaller user bases by simulating our statistical inferences on small N.\nThese results demonstrate that quizzes are a simple and useful technique for\nunderstanding language learning at all scales.",

If the gradient of the\nquadratic cost is being transmitted across a rate-limited channel, both the\nconvergence and the rate of convergence of the resulting controller may be\naffected by the bit-rate permitted by the channel. We first pose this problem\nin a communication-constrained optimization framework and propose a new\nadaptive quantization algorithm titled Adaptively Quantized Gradient Descent\n(AQGD). This algorithm guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the\nglobally optimal policy, with no deterioration of the exponent relative to the\nunquantized setting, above a certain finite threshold bit-rate allowed by the\ncommunication channel. We then propose a variant of AQGD that provides similar\nperformance guarantees when applied to solve the model-free LQR problem. Our\napproach reveals the benefits of adaptive quantization in preserving fast\nlinear convergence rates, and, as such, may be of independent interest to the\nliterature on compressed optimization.

In this paper, we investigate the faithfulness of Concept Bottleneck\nModels (CBMs), a popular family of concept-based architectures, by looking at\nwhether they respect \"localities\" in datasets. Localities involve using only\nrelevant features when predicting a concept's value. When localities are not\nconsidered, concepts may be predicted based on spuriously correlated features,\ndegrading performance and robustness. This work examines how CBM predictions\nchange when perturbing model inputs, and reveals that CBMs may not capture\nlocalities, even when independent concepts are localised to non-overlapping\nfeature subsets. Our empirical and theoretical results demonstrate that\ndatasets with correlated concepts may lead to accurate but uninterpretable\nmodels that fail to learn localities. Overall, we find that CBM\ninterpretability is fragile, as CBMs occasionally rely upon spurious features,\nnecessitating further research into the robustness of concept predictors.",

A broadband comb\nwith gigahertz repetition rates is obtained in the magnonic spectrum and a\ntypical non-perturbation frequency-comb structure is also observed. The total\nwidth of the magnonic comb in the robust plateau region can be up to 400 comb\nlines, which is much broader and flatter than the reported in the previous\nworks. Furthermore, when the dissipative coupling strength is further\nincreased, the chaotic motion is predicted in the magnonic spectrum.

Since NLP is based on human\nlanguage, potentially harmful biases can diffuse into NLP systems and produce\nunfair results, discriminate against minorities or generate legal issues.\nHence, it is important to develop a fairness certification for NLP approaches.\nWe follow a qualitative research approach towards a fairness certification for\nNLP. In particular, we have reviewed a large body of literature on algorithmic\nfairness, and we have conducted semi-structured expert interviews with a wide\nrange of experts from that area. We have systematically devised six fairness\ncriteria for NLP, which can be further refined into 18 sub-categories.

This paper\npresents a novel identification method that delivers additive models for both\nopen and closed-loop setups.

However,\nsuch designs are of limited value for answering standard questions in settings,\ncommon in marketplaces, where multiple populations of agents interact\nstrategically, leading to complex patterns of spillover effects. In this paper,\nwe discuss new experimental designs and corresponding estimands to account for\nand capture these complex spillovers.

                "summary": "High temperature REBCO superconducting tapes are very promising for\nhigh-field magnets. Under high magnetic fields there are high\nelectro-mechanical forces, and thus concern for mechanical damage. Due to large\nscreening currents and composite structure of the tape, the mechanical design\nof these magnets is not straightforward. In addition, many contemporary designs\nuse insulated winding. In this work we develop a novel two-dimensional\naxisymmetric finite element tool programmed in MATLAB that assumes the\ndisplacement field within linear elastic range. The stack of pancakes and a\nlarge number of REBCO tape turns are approximated as an an-isotropic bulk\nhollow cylinder. Our results agree with uni-axial stress experiments in\nliterature, validating the bulk approximation. Here, we study the following\nconfiguration. The current is first ramp up to below the critical current and\nwe calculate the screening currents and the forces that they cause using the\nMEMEP model. As a case study, 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet, is taken and\nsimulated numerically. We have done complete mechanical analysis of the magnet\nby including the axial and shear mechanical quantities for each pancake unlike\nprevious work where only radial and circumferential quantities are focused.\nEffect on mechanical quantities without screening current is also calculated\nand compared. It is shown that including screening current induced field\nstrongly affect the mechanical quantities, specially the shear stress. The\nlatter might be the critical quantity for certain magnet configurations.\nAdditionally, in order to overcome high stresses, a stiff over banding of\ndifferent material is considered and numerically modelled which significantly\nreduces the mechanical stresses. The FE based model developed is efficient to\ncalculate the mechanical behaviour of any general superconductor magnet and its\ndevices.",

In order to circumvent the heavy\ncomputational costs of exploring and optimizing their layouts, we have\ndeveloped a pruning method. It consists in i) running a set of microscopic\nsimulations and interpolate them over a dense, regularly spaced array of\ndetection units, and ii) pruning the unnecessary units out of the layout, in\norder to obtain the shower footprint on a newly shaped layout. This method\noffers flexibility to test various layout parameters, instrumental constraints,\nand physical inputs, with a drastic reduction in the required CPU time. The\nmethod can be universally applied to optimize arrays of any size, and using any\ndetection techniques.\n  For demonstration, we apply the pruning tool to radio antenna layouts, which\nallows us to discuss the interplay between the energy and inclination of\nair-showers on the size of the radio footprint and the intensity of the signal\non the ground. Some rule-of-thumb conclusions that can be drawn for this\nspecific case are: i) a hexagonal geometry is more efficient than a triangular\ngeometry, ii) the detection efficiency of the array is stable to changes in the\nspacing between radio antennas around 1000m step size, iii) for a given number\nof antennas, adding a granular infill on top of a coarse hexagonal array is\nmore efficient than instrumenting the full array with a less dense spacing.",

                "summary": "In deep learning, classification tasks are formalized as optimization\nproblems often solved via the minimization of the cross-entropy. However,\nrecent advancements in the design of objective functions allow the usage of the\n$f$-divergence to generalize the formulation of the optimization problem for\nclassification. We adopt a Bayesian perspective and formulate the\nclassification task as a maximum a posteriori probability problem. We propose a\nclass of objective functions based on the variational representation of the\n$f$-divergence. Furthermore, driven by the challenge of improving the\nstate-of-the-art approach, we propose a bottom-up method that leads us to the\nformulation of an objective function corresponding to a novel $f$-divergence\nreferred to as shifted log (SL). We theoretically analyze the objective\nfunctions proposed and numerically test them in three application scenarios:\ntoy examples, image datasets, and signal detection/decoding problems. The\nanalyzed scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and\nthat the SL divergence achieves the highest classification accuracy in almost\nall the considered cases.",

Given an RKHS $\\mathcal{H}$ associated with an inner product kernel defined\non the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d}$, we suppose that the true function $f_{\\rho}^{*}\n\\in [\\mathcal{H}]^{s}$, the interpolation space of $\\mathcal{H}$ with source\ncondition $s>0$. We first determined the exact order (both upper and lower\nbound) of the generalization error of kernel ridge regression for the optimally\nchosen regularization parameter $\\lambda$. We then further showed that when\n$0<s\\le1$, KRR is minimax optimal; and when $s>1$, KRR is not minimax optimal\n(a.k.a. he saturation effect). Our results illustrate that the curves of rate\nvarying along $\\gamma$ exhibit the periodic plateau behavior and the multiple\ndescent behavior and show how the curves evolve with $s>0$. Interestingly, our\nwork provides a unified viewpoint of several recent works on kernel regression\nin the large-dimensional setting, which correspond to $s=0$ and $s=1$\nrespectively.",

To inhibit ice growth, AFPs must not only\nbind to ice crystals, but also resist engulfment by ice. The highest\nsupercooling, $\\Delta T^{*}$, for which AFPs are able to resist engulfment is\nwidely believed to scale as the inverse of the separation, $L$, between bound\nAFPs, whereas its dependence on the molecular characteristics of the AFP\nremains poorly understood. By using specialized molecular simulations and\ninterfacial thermodynamics, here we show that in contrast with conventional\nwisdom, $\\Delta T^{*}$ scales as $L^{-2}$ and not as $L^{-1}$. We further show\nthat $\\Delta T^{*}$ is proportional to AFP size and that diverse naturally\noccurring AFPs are optimal at resisting engulfment by ice.

                "summary": "Vector quantization-based image semantic communication systems have\nsuccessfully boosted transmission efficiency, but face challenges with\nconflicting requirements between codebook design and digital constellation\nmodulation. Traditional codebooks need wide index ranges, while modulation\nfavors few discrete states. To address this, we propose a multilevel generative\nsemantic communication system with a two-stage training framework. In the first\nstage, we train a high-quality codebook, using a multi-head octonary codebook\n(MOC) to compress the index range. In addition, a residual vector quantization\n(RVQ) mechanism is also integrated for effective multilevel communication. In\nthe second stage, a noise reduction block (NRB) based on Swin Transformer is\nintroduced, coupled with the multilevel codebook from the first stage, serving\nas a high-quality semantic knowledge base (SKB) for generative feature\nrestoration. Finally, to simulate modern image transmission scenarios, we\nemploy a diverse collection of high-resolution 2K images as the test set. The\nexperimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of\nMOC-RVQ over conventional methods such as BPG or JPEG. Additionally, MOC-RVQ\nachieves comparable performance to an analog JSCC scheme, while needing only\none-sixth of the channel bandwidth ratio (CBR) and being directly compatible\nwith digital transmission systems.",

While conventional guidelines offer valuable\ninsights, their efficacy diminishes when confronted with extreme weather\nconditions, such as heatwaves and droughts. In this study, we introduce an\ninnovative framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Leveraging the Gym-DSSAT simulator, we train\nan intelligent agent to master optimal nitrogen fertilization management.\nThrough a series of simulation experiments conducted on corn crops in Iowa, we\ncompare Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) models with Markov\nDecision Process (MDP) models. Our research underscores the advantages of\nutilizing sequential observations in developing more efficient nitrogen input\npolicies. Additionally, we explore the impact of climate variability,\nparticularly during extreme weather events, on agricultural outcomes and\nmanagement. Our findings demonstrate the adaptability of fertilization policies\nto varying climate conditions. Notably, a fixed policy exhibits resilience in\nthe face of minor climate fluctuations, leading to commendable corn yields,\ncost-effectiveness, and environmental conservation. However, our study\nilluminates the need for agent retraining to acquire new optimal policies under\nextreme weather events. This research charts a promising course toward\nadaptable fertilization strategies that can seamlessly align with dynamic\nclimate scenarios, ultimately contributing to the optimization of crop\nmanagement practices.",

Among them, Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs)\nattract considerable attention due to their ability to emotionally engage\nusers. However, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark impedes progress in\nthis field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CharacterEval, a Chinese benchmark\nfor comprehensive RPCA assessment, complemented by a tailored high-quality\ndataset. The dataset comprises 1,785 multi-turn role-playing dialogues,\nencompassing 23,020 examples and featuring 77 characters derived from Chinese\nnovels and scripts. It was carefully constructed, beginning with initial\ndialogue extraction via GPT-4, followed by rigorous human-led quality control,\nand enhanced with in-depth character profiles sourced from Baidu Baike.\nCharacterEval employs a multifaceted evaluation approach, encompassing thirteen\ntargeted metrics on four dimensions. Comprehensive experiments on CharacterEval\ndemonstrate that Chinese LLMs exhibit more promising capabilities than GPT-4 in\nChinese role-playing conversation.

The interactions between the two-dimensional\nDirac holes and the heavy holes lead to the breakdown of Galilean invariance,\nresulting in interaction-limited resistivity. Our exploration of the transport\nproperties spans from low temperatures, where both subsystems are fully\ndegenerate, to higher temperatures, where the Dirac holes remain degenerate\nwhile the heavy holes follow Boltzmann statistics, creating a partially\ndegenerate regime. Through a developed theory, we successfully predict the\nbehavior of resistivity as $\\rho\\sim T^2$ and $\\rho\\sim T^{3}$ for the fully\ndegenerate and partially degenerate regimes, respectively, which is in\nreasonable agreement with experimental observations. Notably, at elevated\ntemperatures, the interaction-limited resistivity surpasses the resistivity\ncaused by impurity scattering by a factor of 5-6. These findings imply that the\ninvestigated system serves as a versatile experimental platform for exploring\nvarious interaction-limited transport regimes in two component plasma.",

                "summary": "At time zero, there are $N$ identical point particles in the line (1D) which\nare characterized by their positions and velocities. Both values are given\nrandomly and independently from each other, with arbitrary probability\ndensities. Each particle evolves at constant velocity until eventually they\nmeet. When this happens, a perfectly-plastic collision is produced, resulting\nin a new particle composed by the sum of their masses and the weighted average\nvelocity.\n  The merged particles evolve indistinguishably from the non-merged ones, i.e.\nthey move at constant velocity until a new plastic collision eventually\nhappens.\n  As in any open system, the particles are not confined to any region or\nreservoir, so as time progresses, they go on to infinity.\n  From this non-equilibrium process, the number of (now, non-identical) final\nparticles, $\\tilde{X}_N$, the distribution of masses of these final particles\nand the kinetic energy loss from all plastic collisions, is studied. The\nprincipal findings shown in this paper are outlined as follows: (1) A method\nhas been developed to determine the number and mass of the final particles\nbased solely on the initial conditions, eliminating the need to evolve the\nparticle system. (2) A similar model of merging particles, with a universal\nnumber of final particles, $\\tilde{Z}_N$, is introduced. (3) Strong evidence\nthat $\\tilde{X}_N$ is also universal and has the same law of probability as\n$\\tilde{Z}_N$ is presented. (4) An accurate approximation of the energy loss is\npresented. (5) Results for $\\tilde{X}_N$ for an explosive-like initial\ncondition are analyzed.",

                "summary": "Large scale analytics engines have become a core dependency for modern\ndata-driven enterprises to derive business insights and drive actions. These\nengines support a large number of analytic jobs processing huge volumes of data\non a daily basis, and workloads are often inundated with overlapping\ncomputations across multiple jobs. Reusing common computation is crucial for\nefficient cluster resource utilization and reducing job execution time.\nDetecting common computation is the first and key step for reducing this\ncomputational redundancy. However, detecting equivalence on large-scale\nanalytics engines requires efficient and scalable solutions that are fully\nautomated. In addition, to maximize computation reuse, equivalence needs to be\ndetected at the semantic level instead of just the syntactic level (i.e., the\nability to detect semantic equivalence of seemingly different-looking queries).\nUnfortunately, existing solutions fall short of satisfying these requirements.\n  In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing\nGEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for\nefficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale. GEqO\nintroduces two machine-learning-based filters that quickly prune out\nnonequivalent subexpressions and employs a semi-supervised learning feedback\nloop to iteratively improve its model with an intelligent sampling mechanism.\nFurther, with its novel database-agnostic featurization method, GEqO can\ntransfer the learning from one workload and database to another. Our extensive\nempirical evaluation shows that, on TPC-DS-like queries, GEqO yields\nsignificant performance gains-up to 200x faster than automated verifiers-and\nfinds up to 2x more equivalences than optimizer and signature-based equivalence\ndetection approaches.",

                "summary": "BACKGROUND: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is based on the\nBlood Oxygenation Level Dependent contrast and has been exploited for the\nindirect study of the neuronal activity within both the brain and the spinal\ncord. However, the interpretation of spinal cord fMRI (scfMRI) is still\ncontroversial and its diffusion is rather limited because of technical\nlimitations. Overcoming these limitations would have a beneficial effect for\nthe assessment and follow-up of spinal injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.\nPURPOSE: This study was aimed at systematically verify whether sagittal\nscanning in scfMRI using EPI readout is a viable alternative to the more common\naxial scanning, and at optimizing a pipeline for EPI-based scfMRI data\nanalysis, based on Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT). METHODS: Forty-five healthy\nsubjects underwent MRI acquisition in a Philips Achieva 3T MRI scanner.\nT2*-weighted fMRI data were acquired using a GE-EPI sequence along sagittal and\naxial planes during an isometric motor task. Differences on benchmarks were\nassessed via paired two-sample t-test at p=0.05. RESULTS: We investigated the\nimpact of the acquisition strategy by means of various metrics such as Temporal\nSignal to Noise Ratio (tSNR), Dice Coefficient to assess geometric distortions,\nReproducibility and Sensitivity. tSNR was higher in axial than in sagittal\nscans, as well as reproducibility within the whole cord mask (t=7.4, p<0.01)\nand within the GM mask (t=4.2, p<0.01). The other benchmarks, associated with\ndistortion and functional response, showed no difference between images\nobtained along the axial and sagittal planes. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative metrics\nof data quality suggest that axial scanning would be the optimal choice. We\nconclude that axial acquisition is advantageous specially to mitigate the\neffects of physiological noise and to minimize inter-subject variance.",

                "summary": "Automatic machine translation metrics typically rely on human translations to\ndetermine the quality of system translations. Common wisdom in the field\ndictates that the human references should be of very high quality. However,\nthere are no cost-benefit analyses that could be used to guide practitioners\nwho plan to collect references for machine translation evaluation. We find that\nhigher-quality references lead to better metric correlations with humans at the\nsegment-level. Having up to 7 references per segment and taking their average\n(or maximum) helps all metrics. Interestingly, the references from vendors of\ndifferent qualities can be mixed together and improve metric success. Higher\nquality references, however, cost more to create and we frame this as an\noptimization problem: given a specific budget, what references should be\ncollected to maximize metric success. These findings can be used by evaluators\nof shared tasks when references need to be created under a certain budget.",

The spins in individual nanoparticles become more\naligned with increasing number of layers, resulting in a larger net\nmagnetization. Our experimental results show a magnetic short-range order in\nthe monolayer due to the proliferation of thermally induced magnetic vortices\nand a magnetic long-range order in the bilayer and trilayer, stemming from the\nstrengthened dipolar interactions that effectively suppress thermal\nfluctuations. We also observe a screening effect of magnetic vortices and the\nattractive interaction between the magnetic vortices with opposite topological\ncharges. Our work demonstrates the crucial role of layered structure in shaping\nthe magnetization of nanoparticle assemblies, providing new opportunities to\nmodulate these properties through strategic layer engineering.",

Our\nstudents need to be able to examine the social complexities in which technology\ndevelopment and use are situated. Also, aligning students' personal goals and\ntheir ability to achieve them in their field of study is important for\npromoting motivation and a sense of belonging. Promoting communal goals while\nlearning computing can help broaden participation, particularly among groups\nwho have been historically marginalized in computing. Keeping these\nconsiderations in mind, we piloted an introductory Java programming course in\nwhich activities engaging students in ethical and socially responsible\nconsiderations were integrated across modules. Rather than adding social on top\nof the technical content, our curricular approach seeks to weave them together.\nThe data from the class suggests that the students found the inclusion of the\nsocial context in the technical assignments to be more motivating and expressed\ngreater agency in realizing social change. We share our approach to designing\nthis new introductory socially responsible computing course and the students'\nreflections.

This challenge\nis further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating\nfrequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new\nknowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many\napplications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address\ndeficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in\nefficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end,\nrecent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for\nLLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains\nwhile preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we\nfirst define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive\nreview of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and\ncognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that\nclassifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external\nknowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive\nempirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches.\nAdditionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can\ngive a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs.\nFinally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing,\noutlining its broad and impactful implications.",

By exploiting elements of\nquantum error correction, qubit toy models of this correspondence have been\nconstructed for which the bulk logical operators are representable by operators\nacting on the boundary. Given a boundary subregion, wedges in the volume space\nare used to enclose the bulk qubits for which logical operators are\nreconstructable on that boundary subregion. In this thesis a number of\ndifferent wedges, such as the causal wedge, greedy entanglement wedge and\nminimum entanglement wedge, are examined. More specifically, Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of boundary erasure are performed with various toy models to study\nthe differences between wedges and the effect on these wedge by the type of the\nmodel, non-uniform boundaries and stacking of models. It has been found that\nthe minimum entanglement wedge is the best approximate for the true geometric\nwedge. This is illustrated by an example toy model for which an operator beyond\nthe greedy entanglement wedge was also reconstructed. In addition, by\ncalculating the entropy of these subregions, the viability of a mutual\ninformation wedge is rejected. Only for particular connected boundary\nsubregions was the inclusion of the central tensor by the geometric wedge\nassociated to a rise in mutual information.",

                "summary": "We study a variant of the searching problem where the environment consists of\na known terrain and the goal is to obtain visibility of an unknown target point\non the surface of the terrain. The searcher starts on the surface of the\nterrain and is allowed to fly above the terrain. The goal is to devise a\nsearching strategy that minimizes the competitive ratio, that is, the\nworst-case ratio between the distance traveled by the searching strategy and\nthe minimum travel distance needed to detect the target. For $1.5$D terrains we\nshow that any searching strategy has a competitive ratio of at least\n$\\sqrt{82}$ and we present a nearly-optimal searching strategy that achieves a\ncompetitive ratio of $3\\sqrt{19/2} \\approx \\sqrt{82} + 0.19$. This strategy\nextends directly to the case where the searcher has no knowledge of the terrain\nbeforehand. For $2.5$D terrains we show that the optimal competitive ratio\ndepends on the maximum slope $\\lambda$ of the terrain, and is hence unbounded\nin general. Specifically, we provide a lower bound on the competitive ratio of\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\lambda})$. Finally, we complement the lower bound with a\nsearching strategy based on the maximum slope of the known terrain, which\nachieves a competitive ratio of $O(\\sqrt{\\lambda})$.",

                "summary": "Computing reduced-order models using non-intrusive methods is particularly\nattractive for systems that are simulated using black-box solvers. However,\nobtaining accurate data-driven models can be challenging, especially if the\nunderlying systems exhibit large-amplitude transient growth. Although these\nsystems may evolve near a low-dimensional subspace that can be easily\nidentified using standard techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\n(POD), computing accurate models often requires projecting the state onto this\nsubspace via a non-orthogonal projection. While appropriate oblique projection\noperators can be computed using intrusive techniques that leverage the form of\nthe underlying governing equations, purely data-driven methods currently tend\nto achieve dimensionality reduction via orthogonal projections, and this can\nlead to models with poor predictive accuracy. In this paper, we address this\nissue by introducing a non-intrusive framework designed to simultaneously\nidentify oblique projection operators and reduced-order dynamics. In\nparticular, given training trajectories and assuming reduced-order dynamics of\npolynomial form, we fit a reduced-order model by solving an optimization\nproblem over the product manifold of a Grassmann manifold, a Stiefel manifold,\nand several linear spaces (as many as the tensors that define the low-order\ndynamics). Furthermore, we show that the gradient of the cost function with\nrespect to the optimization parameters can be conveniently written in\nclosed-form, so that there is no need for automatic differentiation. We compare\nour formulation with state-of-the-art methods on three examples: a\nthree-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, the complex\nGinzburg-Landau (CGL) equation, and a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at\nReynolds number Re = 8300.",

But to what\nextent is generative AI already in use in the public sector? Our survey of 938\npublic service professionals within the UK (covering education, health, social\nwork and emergency services) seeks to answer this question. We find that use of\ngenerative AI systems is already widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of\ngenerative AI usage within their area of work, while 22% actively use a\ngenerative AI system. Public sector professionals were positive about both\ncurrent use of the technology and its potential to enhance their efficiency and\nreduce bureaucratic workload in the future. For example, those working in the\nNHS thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop from 50% to 30% if\ngenerative AI was properly exploited, an equivalent of one day per week (an\nenormous potential impact). Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%)\naround generative AI outputs, and a low fear of replacement (16%). While\nrespondents were optimistic overall, areas of concern included feeling like the\nUK is missing out on opportunities to use AI to improve public services (76%),\nand only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on\ngenerative AI usage in their workplaces. In other words, it is clear that\ngenerative AI is already transforming the public sector, but uptake is\nhappening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines. The UK's public\nsector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage\nof the technology.",

The resulting algorithm is mesh-free, highly\nparallelizable and able to compute solutions pointwise, thus mitigating the\ncurse of dimensionality in a practical sense. We analyze various nuances of\nthis algorithm that are determined by the drift term in the Fokker-Planck\nequation. We work with problems ranging in dimensions from 2 to 10. We\ndemonstrate that this algorithm requires orders of magnitude fewer trajectories\nfor each point in space when compared to Monte-Carlo.

However, in the literature, most privacy-preserving\nalgorithms demand learning objectives to be strongly convex and Lipschitz\nsmooth, which thus cannot cover a wide class of robust loss functions (e.g.,\nquantile/least absolute loss). In this work, we aim to develop a fast\nprivacy-preserving learning solution for a sparse robust regression problem.\nOur learning loss consists of a robust least absolute loss and an $\\ell_1$\nsparse penalty term. To fast solve the non-smooth loss under a given privacy\nbudget, we develop a Fast Robust And Privacy-Preserving Estimation (FRAPPE)\nalgorithm for least absolute deviation regression. Our algorithm achieves a\nfast estimation by reformulating the sparse LAD problem as a penalized least\nsquare estimation problem and adopts a three-stage noise injection to guarantee\nthe $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy. We show that our algorithm can\nachieve better privacy and statistical accuracy trade-off compared with the\nstate-of-the-art privacy-preserving regression algorithms. In the end, we\nconduct experiments to verify the efficiency of our proposed FRAPPE algorithm.",

In this\npaper we define an algebra structure on an RKHS that is equivalent to\nsubconvolutivity of the weight for known examples (referred to as reproducing\nkernel Hilbert algebras, or RKHAs). We show that the class of RKHAs is closed\nunder the Hilbert space tensor product and the pullback construction on the\ncategory of RKHSs.

When a single, quadratic\ncondition is imposed on the parameters of the 22 such irrelevant deformations,\nthe asymptotics of the solution degenerate to a linear dilaton like spacetime.\nWe identify each such degeneration limit with a known decoupling limit of\nstring theory, which yields little string theory or deformations thereof (the\nso-called open brane LST, or ODp theories), compactified to two dimensions.\nThis suggests that a 21-parameter family of the above deformations leads to\nUV-complete theories, which are string theories decoupled from gravity that are\ncontinuously connected to each other. All these theories have been argued to\ndisplay Hagedorn behaviour; we show that including the F1 strings leads to an\nadditional Cardy term. The resulting entropy formula closely resembles that of\nsingle-trace $T\\bar T$-deformed CFTs, whose generalisations could provide\npossibly tractable effective two-dimensional descriptions of the above web of\ntheories.\n  We also consider the asymptotically flat black strings. At fixed temperature,\nthe partition function is dominated by thermodynamically stable, small black\nstring solutions, similar to the ones in the decoupled backgrounds. We show\nthat certain asymptotic symmetries of these black strings bear a striking\nresemblance with the state-dependent symmetries of single-trace $T\\bar T$, and\nbreak down precisely when the background solution reaches the large black\nstring threshold. This suggests that small, asymptotically flat black strings\nmay also admit a $T\\bar T$ - like effective description.",

The ``only if'' part follows from the properties of\nthe so-called layered wheels due to Sintiari and Trotignon.\n  Alecu, Chudnovsky, Spirkl and the author recently proved the conjecture in\ntwo special cases: (a) when $t=4$; and (b) when $H=cone (F)$ for some forest\n$F$; that is, $H$ is obtained from $F$ by adding a universal vertex. Our first\nresult is a common strengthening: for an integer $t\\geq 4$ and graphs $F$ and\n$H$, (even-hole, $cone(cone (F))$, $H$, $K_t$)-free graphs have bounded\ntreewidth if and only if $F$ is a forest and $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph.\n  Also, for general $t\\geq 4$, we push the current state of the art further\nthan (b) by settling the conjecture for the smallest choices of $H$ that are\nnot coned forests. This follows from our second result: we prove the conjecture\nwhen $H$ is a crystal; that is, a graph obtained from several coned double\nstars by gluing them together along the middle edges of the double stars.\n  In the first version of this paper, we suggested a strengthening of our main\nconjecture, that for every $t\\geq 1$, every graph of sufficiently large\ntreewidth has an induced subgraph of treewidth $t$ which is either complete,\ncomplete bipartite, or $2$-degenerate. This strengthening has now been refuted\nby Chudnovsky and Trotignon [On treewidth and maximum cliques,\narXiv:2405.07471, 2024].",

The phonon and exciton\nemissions are shown to vary in accordance with our strain field designs,\nenabling us to write and draw any photoluminescence color image in a single\nchip. Moreover, our strain engineering offers a powerful means to significantly\nand controllably alter the strengths and energies of interlayer excitons at\nroom temperature.

These models are increasingly\nbeing used to augment legal practice, education, and research, yet their\nrevolutionary potential is threatened by the presence of hallucinations --\ntextual output that is not consistent with legal facts. We present the first\nsystematic evidence of these hallucinations, documenting LLMs' varying\nperformance across jurisdictions, courts, time periods, and cases. Our work\nmakes four key contributions. First, we develop a typology of legal\nhallucinations, providing a conceptual framework for future research in this\narea. Second, we find that legal hallucinations are alarmingly prevalent,\noccurring between 58% of the time with ChatGPT 4 and 88% with Llama 2, when\nthese models are asked specific, verifiable questions about random federal\ncourt cases. Third, we illustrate that LLMs often fail to correct a user's\nincorrect legal assumptions in a contra-factual question setup. Fourth, we\nprovide evidence that LLMs cannot always predict, or do not always know, when\nthey are producing legal hallucinations. Taken together, our findings caution\nagainst the rapid and unsupervised integration of popular LLMs into legal\ntasks. Even experienced lawyers must remain wary of legal hallucinations, and\nthe risks are highest for those who stand to benefit from LLMs the most -- pro\nse litigants or those without access to traditional legal resources.",

This notion was discovered and rediscovered in several contexts including\nalgebraic complexity theory (in Strassen's work on tensor rank), in numerical\nanalysis for the construction of cubature formulas and in quantum mechanics for\nthe study of computational methods and the study of the so-called \"quantum Zeno\ndynamics.\" Commuting extensions have also attracted the attention of the linear\nalgebra community. In this paper we present 3 types of results:\n  (i) Theorems on the uniqueness of commuting extensions for three matrices or\nmore.\n  (ii) Algorithms for the computation of commuting extensions of minimal size.\nThese algorithms work under the same assumptions as our uniqueness theorems.\nThey are applicable up to r=4n/3, and are apparently the first provably\nefficient algorithms for this problem applicable beyond r=n+1.\n  (iii) A genericity theorem showing that our algorithms and uniqueness\ntheorems can be applied to a wide range of input matrices.",

                "summary": "Manual delineation of tumor regions from magnetic resonance (MR) images is\ntime-consuming, requires an expert, and is prone to human error. In recent\nyears, deep learning models have been the go-to approach for the segmentation\nof brain tumors. U-Net and its' variants for semantic segmentation of medical\nimages have achieved good results in the literature. However, U-Net and its'\nvariants tend to over-segment tumor regions and may not accurately segment the\ntumor edges. The edges of the tumor are as important as the tumor regions for\naccurate diagnosis, surgical precision, and treatment planning. In the proposed\nwork, the authors aim to extract edges from the ground truth using a\nderivative-like filter followed by edge reconstruction to obtain an edge ground\ntruth in addition to the brain tumor ground truth. Utilizing both ground\ntruths, the author studies several U-Net and its' variant architectures with\nand without tumor edges ground truth as a target along with the tumor ground\ntruth for brain tumor segmentation. The author used the BraTS2020 benchmark\ndataset to perform the study and the results are tabulated for the dice and\nHausdorff95 metrics. The mean and median metrics are calculated for the whole\ntumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET) regions. Compared to the\nbaseline U-Net and its variants, the models that learned edges along with the\ntumor regions performed well in core tumor regions in both training and\nvalidation datasets. The improved performance of edge-trained models trained on\nbaseline models like U-Net and V-Net achieved performance similar to baseline\nstate-of-the-art models like Swin U-Net and hybrid MR-U-Net. The edge-target\ntrained models are capable of generating edge maps that can be useful for\ntreatment planning. Additionally, for further explainability of the results,\nthe activation map generated by the hybrid MR-U-Net has been studied.",

                "summary": "In this paper, we validate the performance of the a sensor fusion-based\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework\nfor Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS\nreceiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used. The detection\nframework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing\nthe predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two\nconsecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift. For this\npurpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the\naccelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) neural network. The second strategy employs a Random-Forest\nsupervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing\nbetween left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor.\nIn experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong\nturn are simulated. These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection\nattacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives\ninjected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to\ndetect legitimate GNSS signals. Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised\nthroughout the spoofing attack. To test the effectiveness of the detection\nframework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road\nstructures. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various\nsophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting\nattacks. Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy\nof the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding\nAVs against GNSS spoofing threats.",

Initially, we investigate the\nconcept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum\ncomputer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies\nhave established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken\nto return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the\nsampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances.\nOur findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism\nin laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads\nto a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our\nnewly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these\nphenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near\nresonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the\nfluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our\nunderstanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and\ndynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient\nquantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.",

They are also the building blocks of a variety of\nsymmetry and topologically protected structures, especially on integrated\nphotonic platforms. As the name suggests, it consists of two coupled\noscillators, which can be optical, mechanical, electronic, and so on in nature.\nIn this article, we show that its effective size, defined by the number of\nlattice sites inversely proportional to the lattice momentum, is surprisingly\nthree instead of two from the perspective of energy quantization. More\nspecifically, we show analytically that the complex energy levels of a\none-dimensional concatenated chain with $N$ PT-dimers are determined by a\nsystem size of $1+2N$, which reduces to three in the case of a single PT-dimer.\nWe note that while energy quantization conditions were established in various\nnon-Hermitian systems, exact and explicitly quantized complex energies as\nreported here are still scarce. In connection, we also discuss the other\nsymmetries of a PT-dimer and concatenated PT-dimer chain, including\nnon-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry.",

                "summary": "We present the analytical and numerical results on the collective excitation\nspectrum of quasi-one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. The collective excitation spectrum, using Bogoliubov-de-Gennes\ntheory, reveals the existence of a diverse range of phases in the SO and Rabi\n($k_L-\\Omega$) coupling plane. Based on eigenvalue of the excitation spectrum,\nwe categorize the $k_L-\\Omega$ plane into three distinct regions. In region I,\na stable mode with phonon-like excitations is observed. In region IIa, single\nand multi-band instabilities are noted with a gapped mode, while multi-band\ninstability accompanied by a gapless mode between low-lying and first excited\nstates is realized in region IIb, which also provides evidence of unstable\navoided crossing between low-lying and first excited modes The gap between\nlow-lying and first-excited states increases upon increasing the Rabi coupling\nwhile decreases upon increase of SO coupling. Using eigenvector analysis, we\nconfirm the presence of the spin-dipole mode in the spin-like modes in Region\nII. We corroborate the nature of the collective excitation through real-time\ndynamical evolution of the ground state perturbed with the quench of the trap\nusing the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii model. This analysis suggests the\npresence of dynamical instability leading to the disappearance of the $0$-th\ncomponent of the condensate. In Region III, mainly encompassing $\\Omega \\sim 0$\nand finite $k_L$, we observe phonon-like excitations in both the first excited\nand the low-lying state. The eigenvectors in this region reveal alternative in-\nand out-of-phase behaviours of the spin components. Numerical analysis reveals\nthe presence of a super stripe phase for small Rabi coupling in this region,\nwherein the eigenvector indicates the presence of more complicated\nspin-like-density mixed modes.",

Our approach leverages a pair of\npolarization-dependent loss emulators to attenuate highly polarized crosstalk\nthat results from imperfect isolation of conventional signals copropagating on\nshared fiber links. We demonstrate our technique both on the tabletop and over\na deployed quantum local area network, finding a substantial improvement of\ntwo-qubit entangled state fidelity from approximately 75\\% to over 92\\%.

                "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write\nhuman-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate\ngenerating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of\nhallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these\npowerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.\nThe journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily\nrelies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI\nsystems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of\nonline text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive\nlanguage fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information\nfrom the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or\nmodifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes\nhugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive\napplications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports,\netc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed\nto mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023),\nCoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we\nintroduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various\nparameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and\nretriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches\nspecifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we\nanalyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing\na solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related\nphenomena within the realm of LLMs.",

More precisely, we conjecture that for\na projective klt log pair $(X,D)$ of absolute coregularity $c$ (and arbitrary\ndimension) the fundamental group $\\pi_1^{\\rm reg}(X,D)$ admits a normal abelian\nsubgroup of finite index and rank at most $2c$. We prove this conjecture in the\ncases $0 \\leq c \\leq 3$, building on the almost abelianity of the fundamental\ngroups of klt Calabi-Yau pairs of dimension $\\leq 3$. In the cases $c \\in\n\\{0,1,2\\}$ and fixed dimension, we can furthermore bound the index of a\nsolvable normal subgroup. In dimension three, we are able to prove almost\nabelianity of the fundamental group of the regular locus for projective klt\nCalabi-Yau pairs.",

                "summary": "We propose a model of a twisted accretion disc around a Kerr black hole\ninteracting with a secondary black hole of a smaller mass on an inclined\neccentric orbit. We use parameters of the system, which may be appropriate for\nthe so-called 'precessing massive' model of OJ 287. We calculate expressions\nfor torque exerted on the disc by the secondary and a contribution of the\nsecondary to the apsidal precession of disc elements by a double averaging\nprocedure over the periods of the secondary and the disc elements. These\nexpressions are used at all scales of interest, including the ones inside the\nbinary orbit. We calculate numerically the evolution of the disc tilt and twist\nassuming a flat initial configuration. We consider the disc aspect ratio\n$h/r=10^{-3}$, a rather large viscosity parameter $\\alpha=0.1$ and several\nvalues of the primary rotational parameter, $\\chi$. We find that, after a few\nperiods of Lense-Thirring precession of the orbit, the disc relaxes to a\nquasi-stationary configuration in the precessing frame with a non-trivial\ndistribution of the disc inclination angle, $\\beta$, over the radial scale. We\npropose an analytic model for this configuration. We show that the presence of\nthe twisted disc leads to multiple crossings of the disc by the secondary per\none orbital period, with time periods between the crossings being different\nfrom the flat disc model. Our results should be taken into account in the\nmodelling of OJ 287. They can also be applied to similar sources.",

Carbon\nmonoxide (CO) was detected in absorption in the 2.3-$\\mu$m region for each\nobservation. We measured the strength of CO absorption using the 2-0 band head\nin the feature for each observation and confirm that the CO varies with\npulsation. We show that these measurements follow the $(J-K)$ colour curve,\nconfirming that temperature drives the destruction of CO. By obtaining\nconvolved filter magnitudes from the spectral data we found that the effect of\nthe CO feature on $K$ magnitudes is small, unlike the CO feature in the\nmid-infrared at 4.5-$\\mu$m. The dissociation of CO in the near-infrared spectra\ntracks with the effect seen in the mid-infrared photometric measurements of a\nsimilar Galactic Cepheid. Confirmation of the varying CO feature illustrates\nthe need for further investigations into the related mid-infrared\nperiod-colour-metallicity relation in order to address the impact of Cepheid\nmetallicities on the Hubble tension.",

Because these representations are often\nstudied in different contexts (many-body physics, machine learning, formal\nverification, simulation), little is known about fundamental trade-offs between\ntheir succinctness and the runtime of operations to update them. We therefore\nanalytically investigate three widely-used quantum state representations:\nmatrix product states (MPS), decision diagrams (DDs), and restricted Boltzmann\nmachines (RBMs). We map the relative succinctness of these data structures and\nprovide the complexity for relevant query and manipulation operations. Further,\nto chart the balance between succinctness and operation efficiency, we extend\nthe concept of rapidity with support for the non-canonical data structures\nstudied in this work, showing in particular that MPS is at least as rapid as\nsome DDs.\n  By providing a knowledge compilation map for quantum state representations,\nthis paper contributes to the understanding of the inherent time and space\nefficiency trade-offs in this area.",

We investigate in\ndetail the production of $W$-boson pairs at $e^+e^-$ colliders, and compute the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order mixed QCD-EW corrections to both the integrated\ncross section and various kinematic distributions. By employing the method of\ndifferential equations, we analytically calculate the two-loop master integrals\nfor the mixed QCD-EW virtual corrections to $e^+e^- \\rightarrow W^+W^-$.\nUtilizing the Magnus transformation, we derive a set of canonical master\nintegrals for each integral family. This canonical basis satisfies a system of\ndifferential equations in which the dependence on the dimensional regulator is\nlinearly factorized from the kinematics. We then express all these canonical\nmaster integrals as Taylor series in $\\epsilon$ up to $\\epsilon^4$, with\ncoefficients articulated in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms up to weight\nfour. Upon applying our analytic expressions of these master integrals to the\nphenomenological analysis of $W$-pair production, we observe that the\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha\\alpha_s)$ corrections are significantly impactful in the\n$\\alpha(0)$ scheme, particularly in certain phase-space regions. However, these\nmixed QCD-EW corrections can be heavily suppressed by adopting the $G_{\\mu}$\nscheme.",

For decision\ntables from closed classes, we study lower bounds on the minimum cardinality of\nreducts, which are minimal sets of attributes that allow us to recognize, for a\ngiven row, the decision attached to it. We assume that the number of rows in\ndecision tables from the closed class is not bounded from above by a constant.\nWe divide the set of such closed classes into two families. In one family, only\nstandard lower bounds $\\Omega (\\log $ ${\\rm cl}(T))$ on the minimum cardinality\nof reducts for decision tables hold, where ${\\rm cl}(T)$ is the number of\ndecision classes in the table $T$. In another family, these bounds can be\nessentially tightened up to $\\Omega ({\\rm cl}(T)^{1/q})$ for some natural $q$.",

                "summary": "It is well known that LLMs cannot generalize well to long contexts whose\nlengths are larger than the training sequence length. This poses challenges\nwhen employing LLMs for processing long input sequences during inference. In\nthis work, we argue that LLMs themselves have inherent capabilities to handle\nlong contexts without fine-tuning. To achieve this goal, we propose SelfExtend\nto extend the context window of LLMs by constructing bi-level attention\ninformation: the grouped attention and the neighbor attention. The grouped\nattention captures the dependencies among tokens that are far apart, while\nneighbor attention captures dependencies among adjacent tokens within a\nspecified range. The two-level attentions are computed based on the original\nmodel's self-attention mechanism during inference. With minor code\nmodification, our SelfExtend can effortlessly extend existing LLMs' context\nwindow without any fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmarks and the results show that our SelfExtend can effectively\nextend existing LLMs' context window length.

In contrast to conventional generative information\nextraction models that are left-to-right token-level generators, our approach\nis \\textit{span-based}. It generates a linearized graph where nodes represent\ntext spans and edges represent relation triplets. Our method employs a\ntransformer encoder-decoder architecture with pointing mechanism on a dynamic\nvocabulary of spans and relation types. Our model can capture the structural\ncharacteristics and boundaries of entities and relations through span\nrepresentations while simultaneously grounding the generated output in the\noriginal text thanks to the pointing mechanism. Evaluation on benchmark\ndatasets validates the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating competitive\nresults. Code is available at https://github.com/urchade/ATG.",

                "summary": "The quasi-optical propagation of millimeter-wave signals enables\nhigh-accuracy localization algorithms that employ geometric approaches or\nmachine learning models. However, most algorithms require information on the\nindoor environment, may entail the collection of large training datasets, or\nbear an infeasible computational burden for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)\ndevices. In this work, we propose to use tiny neural networks (NNs) to learn\nthe relationship between angle difference-of-arrival (ADoA) measurements and\nlocations of a receiver in an indoor environment. To relieve training data\ncollection efforts, we resort to a self-supervised approach by bootstrapping\nthe training of our neural network through location estimates obtained from a\nstate-of-the-art localization algorithm. We evaluate our scheme via mmWave\nmeasurements from indoor 60-GHz double-directional channel sounding. We process\nthe measurements to yield dominant multipath components, use the corresponding\nangles to compute ADoA values, and finally obtain location fixes. Results show\nthat the tiny NN achieves sub-meter errors in 74% of the cases, thus performing\nas good as or even better than the state-of-the-art algorithm, with\nsignificantly lower computational complexity.",

Among these platforms,\nnitrogen-vacancy centers have attracted considerable attention with ambient\noperating conditions. However, the current performance of NV gyroscopes remains\nlimited by the degraded coherence when operating with large spin ensembles.\nProtecting the coherence of these systems requires a systematic study of the\ncoherence decay mechanism. Here we present the use of nitrogen-15 nuclear spins\nof NV centers in building gyroscopes, benefiting from its simpler energy\nstructure and vanishing nuclear quadrupole term compared with nitrogen-14\nnuclear spins, though suffering from different challenges in coherence\nprotection. We systematically reveal the coherence decay mechanism of the\nnuclear spin in different NV electronic spin manifolds and further develop a\nrobust coherence protection protocol based on controlling the NV electronic\nspin only, achieving a 15-fold dephasing time improvement. With the developed\ncoherence protection, we demonstrate an emulated gyroscope by measuring a\ndesigned rotation rate pattern, showing an order-of-magnitude sensitivity\nimprovement.",

Conventional\nspin-based gyroscopes measure the accumulated phase of a nuclear spin\nsuperposition state to extract the rotation rate and thus suffer from spin\ndephasing. Here, we propose a gyroscope protocol based on a two-spin system\nthat includes a spin intrinsically tied to the host material, while the other\nspin is isolated. The rotation rate is then extracted by measuring the relative\nrotation angle between the two spins starting from their population states,\nrobust against spin dephasing. In particular, the relative rotation rate\nbetween the two spins can be enhanced by their hyperfine coupling by more than\nan order of magnitude, further boosting the achievable sensitivity. The\nultimate sensitivity of the gyroscope is limited by the lifetime of the spin\nsystem and compatible with a broad dynamic range, even in the presence of\nmagnetic noises or control errors due to initialization and qubit\nmanipulations. Our result enables precise measurement of slow rotations and\nexploration of fundamental physics.",

                "summary": "Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we\ndelve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the\nneed for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new\nfine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a\nsupervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism,\nwhere the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself.\nMore specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous\niterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses\nfrom those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively\nelevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full\npotential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we\nprove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method\nis achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution.\nEmpirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the\nHuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our\nresults show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a\nvariety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct\npreference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data.\nThis sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of\nhuman-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents.

This paper studies the equivariant Morse-Bott\ntheory on the leaf space of the Riemannian foliations in this setting. Among\nother things, we establish a foliated version of the Morse-Bott lemma for a\ng-invariant basic Morse-Bott function, and a foliated version of the usual\nhandle presentation theorem. In the non-equivariant case, we apply these\nresults to present a new proof of the Morse inequalities on Riemannian\nfoliations. In the equivariant case, we apply these results to study\nHamiltonian action of an abelian Lie algebra on a presymplectic manifold whose\nunderlying foliation is also Riemannian, and extend the Kirwan surjectivity and\ninjectivity theorem in equivariant symplectic geometry to this situation. Among\nother things, this implies the Kirwan surjectivity and injectivity hold for\nHamiltonian torus actions on symplectic orbifolds.",

                "summary": "This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban streets for\nautonomous driving scenes. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked\nvehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of\ndynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow\ntraining and rendering speed. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit\nscene representation that tackles these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic\nurban scene is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic\nlogits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or\nthe background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each\nobject point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a 4D\nspherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit\nrepresentation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which\nin turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 135 FPS (1066\n$\\times$ 1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed method\nis evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and Waymo Open\ndatasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across all datasets. The code will be released to\nensure reproducibility.",

First,\nwe decouple the dance generation network from the dance control network,\nthereby avoiding the degradation in dance quality when adding additional\ncontrol information.

                "summary": "The understanding of the convoluted evolution of infant brain networks during\nthe first postnatal year is pivotal for identifying the dynamics of early brain\nconnectivity development. Existing deep learning solutions suffer from three\nmajor limitations. First, they cannot generalize to multi-trajectory prediction\ntasks, where each graph trajectory corresponds to a particular imaging modality\nor connectivity type (e.g., T1-w MRI). Second, existing models require\nextensive training datasets to achieve satisfactory performance which are often\nchallenging to obtain. Third, they do not efficiently utilize incomplete time\nseries data. To address these limitations, we introduce FedGmTE-Net++, a\nfederated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Using the power of\nfederation, we aggregate local learnings among diverse hospitals with limited\ndatasets. As a result, we enhance the performance of each hospital's local\ngenerative model, while preserving data privacy. The three key innovations of\nFedGmTE-Net++ are: (i) presenting the first federated learning framework\nspecifically designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction in a\ndata-scarce environment, (ii) incorporating an auxiliary regularizer in the\nlocal objective function to exploit all the longitudinal brain connectivity\nwithin the evolution trajectory and maximize data utilization, (iii)\nintroducing a two-step imputation process, comprising a preliminary KNN-based\nprecompletion followed by an imputation refinement step that employs regressors\nto improve similarity scores and refine imputations. Our comprehensive\nexperimental results showed the outperformance of FedGmTE-Net++ in brain\nmulti-trajectory prediction from a single baseline graph in comparison with\nbenchmark methods.",

We\nintroduce Transitivity Graph Neural Network (TransGNN), which more than local\nnode similarities, takes into account global similarities by distinguishing\nstrong transitivity relations from weak ones and exploiting them.

                "summary": "Traditionally, pathological analysis and diagnosis are performed by manually\neyeballing glass slide specimens under a microscope by an expert. The whole\nslide image is the digital specimen produced from the glass slide. Whole slide\nimage enabled specimens to be observed on a computer screen and led to\ncomputational pathology where computer vision and artificial intelligence are\nutilized for automated analysis and diagnosis. With the current computational\nadvancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without\nhuman supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis\nif the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or\nair bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely\non experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from\nthe analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the\ngoal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their\nseverity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data.\nTherefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity\nautomatically. In this paper, we propose a system that incorporates severity\nevaluation with artifact detection utilizing convolutional neural networks. The\nproposed system uses DoubleUNet to segment artifacts and an ensemble network of\nsix fine tuned convolutional neural network models to determine severity. This\nmethod outperformed current state of the art in accuracy by 9 percent for\nartifact segmentation and achieved a strong correlation of 97 percent with the\nevaluation of pathologists for severity assessment. The robustness of the\nsystem was demonstrated using our proposed heterogeneous dataset and practical\nusability was ensured by integrating it with an automated analysis system.",

We also propose a novel subject and\nobject based seeding strategy for diffusion sampling which improves the\ndiscriminative capability of the generated visual embeddings.

                "summary": "WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)\nenables contactless, long-range sensing in spatially constrained environments\nwhile preserving visual privacy. However, despite the presence of numerous\nWiFi-enabled devices around us, few expose CSI to users, resulting in a lack of\nsensing hardware options. Variants of the Espressif ESP32 have emerged as\npotential low-cost and easy-to-deploy solutions for WiFi CSI-based HAR. In this\nwork, four ESP32-S3-based 2.4GHz directional antenna systems are evaluated for\ntheir ability to facilitate long-range through-wall HAR. Two promising systems\nare proposed, one of which combines the ESP32-S3 with a directional biquad\nantenna. This combination represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first\ndemonstration of such a system in WiFi-based HAR. The second system relies on\nthe built-in printed inverted-F antenna (PIFA) of the ESP32-S3 and achieves\ndirectionality through a plane reflector. In a comprehensive evaluation of\nline-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) HAR performance, both systems\nare deployed in an office environment spanning a distance of 18 meters across\nfive rooms. In this experimental setup, the Wallhack1.8k dataset, comprising\n1806 CSI amplitude spectrograms of human activities, is collected and made\npublicly available. Based on Wallhack1.8k, we train activity recognition models\nusing the EfficientNetV2 architecture to assess system performance in LOS and\nNLOS scenarios. For the core NLOS activity recognition problem, the biquad\nantenna and PIFA-based systems achieve accuracies of 92.0$\\pm$3.5 and\n86.8$\\pm$4.7, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of long-range\nthrough-wall HAR with the proposed systems.",

                "summary": "Neural implicit fields, such as the neural signed distance field (SDF) of a\nshape, have emerged as a powerful representation for many applications, e.g.,\nencoding a 3D shape and performing collision detection. Typically, implicit\nfields are encoded by Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) with positional encoding\n(PE) to capture high-frequency geometric details. However, a notable side\neffect of such PE-equipped MLPs is the noisy artifacts present in the learned\nimplicit fields. While increasing the sampling rate could in general mitigate\nthese artifacts, in this paper we aim to explain this adverse phenomenon\nthrough the lens of Fourier analysis. We devise a tool to determine the\nappropriate sampling rate for learning an accurate neural implicit field\nwithout undesirable side effects. Specifically, we propose a simple yet\neffective method to estimate the intrinsic frequency of a given network with\nrandomized weights based on the Fourier analysis of the network's responses. It\nis observed that a PE-equipped MLP has an intrinsic frequency much higher than\nthe highest frequency component in the PE layer. Sampling against this\nintrinsic frequency following the Nyquist-Sannon sampling theorem allows us to\ndetermine an appropriate training sampling rate. We empirically show in the\nsetting of SDF fitting that this recommended sampling rate is sufficient to\nsecure accurate fitting results, while further increasing the sampling rate\nwould not further noticeably reduce the fitting error. Training PE-equipped\nMLPs simply with our sampling strategy leads to performances superior to the\nexisting methods.",

Unfortunately, its real-time application is limited by the\nexponential computational complexity. People attempt to address the issue by\ntaking advantage of its mathematical consistency with quantum computing to\nimplement DST operations on quantum circuits and realize speedup. However, the\nprogress so far is still impractical for supporting large-scale DST\napplications. In this paper, we find that Boolean algebra as an essential\nmathematical tool bridges the definition of DST and quantum computing. Based on\nthe discovery, we establish a flexible framework mapping any set-theoretically\ndefined DST operations to corresponding quantum circuits for implementation.\nMore critically, this new framework is not only uniform but also enables\nexponential acceleration for computation and is capable of handling complex\napplications. Focusing on tasks of classification, we based on a classical\nattribute fusion algorithm putting forward a quantum evidential classifier,\nwhere quantum mass functions for attributes are generated with a simple method\nand the proposed framework is applied for fusing the attribute evidence.\nCompared to previous methods, the proposed quantum classifier exponentially\nreduces the computational complexity to linear.

                "summary": "A new variant of Newton's method - named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method\n(BNQN) - which has strong theoretical guarantee, is easy to implement, and has\ngood experimental performance, was recently introduced by the third author.\n  Experiments performed previously showed some remarkable properties of the\nbasins of attractions for finding roots of polynomials and meromorphic\nfunctions, with BNQN. In general, they look more smooth than that of Newton's\nmethod.\n  In this paper, we continue to experimentally explore in depth this remarkable\nphenomenon, and connect BNQN to Newton's flow and Voronoi's diagram. This link\nposes a couple of challenging puzzles to be explained. Experiments also\nindicate that BNQN is more robust against random perturbations than Newton's\nmethod and Random Relaxed Newton's method.",

                "summary": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) or\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for precise (Positioning,\nNavigation, and Timing) PNT solutions. However, the vulnerability of GPS\nsignals to intentional and unintended threats due to their lack of encryption\nand weak signal strength poses serious risks, thereby reducing the reliability\nof AVs. GPS spoofing is a complex and damaging attack that deceives AVs by\naltering GPS receivers to calculate false position and tracking information\nleading to misdirection. This study explores a stealthy slow drift GPS spoofing\nattack, replicating the victim AV's satellite reception pattern while changing\npseudo ranges to deceive the AV, particularly during turns. The attack is\ndesigned to gradually deviate from the correct route, making real-time\ndetection challenging and jeopardizing user safety. We present a system and\nstudy methodology for constructing covert spoofing attacks on AVs,\ninvestigating the correlation between original and spoofed pseudo ranges to\ncreate effective defenses. By closely following the victim vehicle and using\nthe same satellite signals, the attacker executes the attack precisely.\nChanging the pseudo ranges confuses the AV, leading it to incorrect\ndestinations while remaining oblivious to the manipulation. The gradual\ndeviation from the actual route further conceals the attack, hindering its\nswift identification. The experiments showcase a robust correlation between the\noriginal and spoofed pseudo ranges, with R square values varying between 0.99\nand 1. This strong correlation facilitates effective evaluation and mitigation\nof spoofing signals.",

                "summary": "Molecular property optimization (MPO) problems are inherently challenging\nsince they are formulated over discrete, unstructured spaces and the labeling\nprocess involves expensive simulations or experiments, which fundamentally\nlimits the amount of available data. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful\nand popular framework for efficient optimization of noisy, black-box objective\nfunctions (e.g., measured property values), thus is a potentially attractive\nframework for MPO. To apply BO to MPO problems, one must select a structured\nmolecular representation that enables construction of a probabilistic surrogate\nmodel. Many molecular representations have been developed, however, they are\nall high-dimensional, which introduces important challenges in the BO process\n-- mainly because the curse of dimensionality makes it difficult to define and\nperform inference over a suitable class of surrogate models. This challenge has\nbeen recently addressed by learning a lower-dimensional encoding of a SMILE or\ngraph representation of a molecule in an unsupervised manner and then\nperforming BO in the encoded space. In this work, we show that such methods\nhave a tendency to \"get stuck,\" which we hypothesize occurs since the mapping\nfrom the encoded space to property values is not necessarily well-modeled by a\nGaussian process. We argue for an alternative approach that combines numerical\nmolecular descriptors with a sparse axis-aligned Gaussian process model, which\nis capable of rapidly identifying sparse subspaces that are most relevant to\nmodeling the unknown property function. We demonstrate that our proposed method\nsubstantially outperforms existing MPO methods on a variety of benchmark and\nreal-world problems. Specifically, we show that our method can routinely find\nnear-optimal molecules out of a set of more than $>100$k alternatives within\n100 or fewer expensive queries.",

GJ\n367b is a hot (T_eq=1370 K), extremely dense (10.2 +- 1.3 g/cm^3) sub-Earth\norbiting a M dwarf on a 0.32 d orbit. We measure an eclipse depth of 79 +- 4\nppm, a nightside planet-to-star flux ratio of 4 +- 8 ppm, and a relative phase\namplitude of 0.97 +- 0.10 -- all fully consistent with a zero-albedo planet\nwith no heat recirculation. Su ch a scenario is also consistent with the phase\noffset of 11 +- 5 degrees East to within 2.2$\\sigma$. The emission spectrum is\nlikewise consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low\nalbedo of A_B ~ 0.1, with the exception of one anomalous wavelength bin that we\nattribute to unexplained systematics. The emission spectrum puts few\nconstraints on the surface composition, but rules out a CO2 atmosphere >~ 1\nbar, an outgassed atmosphere >~10 mbar (under heavily reducing conditions), or\nan outgassed atmosphere >~0.01 mbar (under heavily oxidizing conditions). The\nlack of day-night heat recirculation implies that 1 bar atmospheres are ruled\nout for a wide range of compositions, while 0.1 bar atmospheres are consistent\nwith the data. Taken together with the fact that most of the dayside should be\nmolten, our JWST observations suggest the planet must have lost the vast\nmajority of its initial inventory of volatiles.",

Quantum chaos can be\ndiagnosed through the analysis of level statistics using e.g.~the spectral form\nfactor, which detects both short- and long-range level correlations. The\nspectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point\nspectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau\nstructure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how\nthis structure could be detected through the quench dynamics of two physical\nquantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival\nprobability and the spin autocorrelation function. The survival probability is\nequivalent to the spectral form factor with an additional filter. When the\nsystem is small, the dip of the correlation hole reaches sufficiently large\nvalues at times which are short enough to be detected with current experimental\nplatforms. As the system is pushed away from chaos, the correlation hole\ndisappears, signaling integrability or localization. We also provide a\nrelatively shallow circuit with which the correlation hole could be detected\nwith commercially available quantum computers.",

From extensive determinantal and dynamical cluster\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations of the half-filled and quarter-filled\nKane-Mele-Hubbard model, we show that for sufficiently strong interactions at\neither half- or quarter-filling, a transition between topological and trivial\ninsulators occurs without the closing of a charge gap. To shed light on this\nbehavior, we illustrate that an exactly solvable model reveals that while the\nsingle-particle gap remains, the many-body gap does in fact close. These two\ngaps are the same in the non-interacting system but depart from each other as\nthe interaction turns on. We purport that for interacting systems, the proper\nprobe of topological phase transitions is the closing of the many-body rather\nthan the single-particle gap.",

                "summary": "Most tidal disruption events (TDEs) are currently found in time-domain\noptical and soft X-ray surveys, both of which are prone to significant\nobscuration. The infrared (IR), however, is a powerful probe of dust-enshrouded\nenvironments, and hence, we recently performed a systematic search of NEOWISE\nmid-IR data for nearby, obscured TDEs within roughly 200 Mpc. We identified 18\nTDE candidates in galactic nuclei, using difference imaging to uncover nuclear\nvariability amongst significant host galaxy emission. These candidates were\nselected based on the following IR light curve properties: (1)\n$L_\\mathrm{W2}\\gtrsim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak, (2) fast rise, followed by\na slow, monotonic decline, (3) no significant prior variability, and (4) no\nevidence for AGN activity in WISE colors. The majority of these sources showed\nno variable optical counterpart, suggesting that optical surveys indeed miss\nnumerous obscured TDEs. Using narrow line ionization levels and variability\narguments, we identified 6 sources as possible underlying AGN, yielding a total\nof 12 TDEs in our gold sample. This gold sample yields a lower limit on the\nIR-selected TDE rate of $2.0\\pm0.3\\times10^{-5}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$\n($1.3\\pm0.2\\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ year$^{-1}$), which is comparable to\noptical and X-ray TDE rates. The IR-selected TDE host galaxies do not show a\ngreen valley overdensity nor a preference for quiescent, Balmer strong\ngalaxies, which are both overrepresented in optical and X-ray TDE samples. This\nIR-selected sample represents a new population of dusty TDEs that have\nhistorically been missed by optical and X-ray surveys and helps alleviate\ntensions between observed and theoretical TDE rates and the so-called missing\nenergy problem.",

A major obstacle to the scalability\nof algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic\ncomplexity of $\\Omega(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible\npairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most\nnetworks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is\nonly $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of\nreconstruction problems that significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline.\nOur algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011)\nthat produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an\nexhaustive quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the\nsecond-neighbor search finishes in log-linear time (Baron & Darling, 2020;\n2022), we demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic\ntime, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\\log\nN)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\\log^2N)$. In\npractice, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders\nof magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with\nour theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables\nthe reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of\nnodes and edges.",

To\ninvestigate these questions, this paper introduces a novel metric of uniqueness\nbased on large language models, develops a new lexicon for divisive speech, and\npresents a framework for comparing the lexical features of political opponents.\nApplying these tools to a variety of corpora of presidential speeches, we find\nconsiderable evidence that Trump's speech patterns diverge from those of all\nmajor party nominees for the presidency in recent history. Some notable\nfindings include Trump's employment of particularly divisive and antagonistic\nlanguage targeting of his political opponents and his patterns of repetition\nfor emphasis. Furthermore, Trump is significantly more distinctive than his\nfellow Republicans, whose uniqueness values are comparably closer to those of\nthe Democrats.

                "summary": "The challenge of accessing specialized adhesives designed for strain gage\napplications has been highlighted due to failures in logistic chains, requiring\nthe exploration of local alternatives. A direct simulation of strain gage\nbonding behavior with two steel plates is infeasible due to the unique\nconstruction of strain gages. Therefore, an indirect simulation method,\ncomparing local alternatives to a widely accepted adhesive, Loctite 496, was\nemployed in this study. Two potential replacements, Loctite 401 and Tekbond\n793, were tested and matched against the benchmark adhesive, with a focus on\nthe key mechanical properties: Proportional Shear Strain (PSS), Proportional\nShear Stress (PSSt), and Apparent Shear Modulus (G*). Loctite 401 exhibited the\nhighest G*, suggesting its potential use in strain gage installations if G* is\nconsidered most important. However, Tekbond 793 demonstrated superior PSS,\nMaximum Shear Stress (MSSt), and Rupture Shear Stress (RSSt) performance,\ndisplaying linear behavior even without an accelerator. Surface preparation\nconsiderations were also discussed, noting that hand abrading results in double\nthe surface roughness than using an orbital sander. The study further\nidentified two main regions concerning failure modes related to Ra, with values\nbelow 0.31 {\\mu}m causing significant variations in observed mechanical\nproperties, pointing towards factors beyond adhesive layer thickness affecting\nbond properties. Lastly, the general recommendation is the use of an\naccelerator for all tested adhesives, while the use of a surface conditioner\nand neutralizer was found to negatively impact adhesive performance.",

                "summary": "Multi-cloud systems facilitate a cost-efficient and\ngeographically-distributed deployment of microservice-based applications by\ntemporary leasing virtual nodes with diverse pricing models. To preserve the\ncost-efficiency of multi-cloud deployments, it is essential to redeploy\nmicroservices onto the available nodes according to a dynamic resource\nconfiguration, which is often performed to better accommodate workload\nvariations. However, this approach leads to frequent service disruption since\napplications are continuously shutdown and redeployed in order to apply the new\nresource assignment. To overcome this issue, we propose a re-orchestration\nscheme that migrates microservice at runtime based on a rolling update\nscheduling logic. Specifically, we propose an integer linear optimization\nproblem that minimizes the cost associated to multi-cloud virtual nodes and\nthat ensures that delay-sensitive microservices are co-located on the same\nregional cluster. The resulting rescheduling order guarantees no service\ndisruption by repacking microservices between the available nodes without the\nneed to turn off the outdated microservice instance before redeploying the\nupdated version. In addition, we propose a two-step heuristic scheme that\neffectively approximates the optimal solution at the expense of close-to-zero\nservice disruption and QoS violation probability. Results show that proposed\nschemes achieve better performance in terms of cost mitigation, low service\ndisruption and low QoS violation probability compared to baseline schemes\nreplicating Kubernetes scheduler functionalities.",

                "summary": "We study the inclusive production of hadrons with bottom flavor at the LHC\nand its luminosity upgrade. We describe the collinear fragmentation of singly\n$b$-flavored hadrons, $B$ mesons and $\\Lambda_b$ baryons, via the KKSS07\ndetermination of fragmentation functions, while for charmed $B$ mesons,\n$B_c(^1S_0)$ and $B_c(^3S_1)$ particles, we employ the novel ZCFW22 set, built\non the basis of state-of-the-art nonrelativistic QCD inputs. We use the JETHAD\nmultimodular working environment to analyze rapidity and transverse-momentum\ndistributions for observables sensitive to the associated emission of two\nhadrons or a hadron-plus-jet system. Our reference formalism is the NLL/NLO$^+$\nhybrid collinear and high-energy factorization, where the standard collinear\ndescription is improved by the inclusions of energy logarithms resummed up to\nthe next-to-leading approximation and beyond. We provide a corroborating\nevidence that $b$-flavor emissions act as fair stabilizers of the high-energy\nresummation, thus serving as valuable tools for precision studies of\nhigh-energy QCD. As a bonus, we highlight that the predicted production-rate\nhierarchy between noncharmed $b$-hadrons and charmed $B_c(^1S_0)$ mesons is in\nline with recent LHCb estimates. This serves as simultaneous benchmark both for\nthe hybrid factorization and for the single-parton fragmentation mechanism\nbased on initial-scale inputs calculated via the nonrelativistic QCD effective\ntheory.",

Unlike previous research papers, authors delve into\nvarious time sources, ranging from atomic time and GPS time to quartz time.\nSpecifically, we explore the time uncertainty associated with the four major\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems. In existing time synchronization\nsimulations provide partial usages. However, our research introduces a\ncomprehensive and precise time synchronization simulation named P-TimeSync,\nleading to a better understanding of time synchronization in distributed\nenvironments. It is a state-of-the-art simulation tool for time because (1) it\ncan simulate atomic clocks and quartz clocks with user-defined software clock\nalgorithms, (2) the simulation provides nanosecond-level precision time across\ndifferent network propagation paths and distances, (3) the tool offers a\nvisualization platform with classic algorithms for distributed time\nsynchronization, such as Cristian's algorithm and Berkeley algorithm. The\nsimulation easily allows for the redefinition of configurations and functions,\nsupporting advanced research and development.

                "summary": "The evolution of the temperature dependence of pseudogap $\\Delta$*(T) in\noptimally doped (OD) YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ (YBCO) films with $T_{c}$ =\n88.7 K under the influence of a magnetic field $B$ up to 8 T has been studied\nin detail. It has been established that the shape of $\\Delta$*(T) for various\n$B$ over the entire range from the pseudogap opening temperature $T$* to\n$T_{01}$, below which superconducting fluctuations occur, has a wide maximum at\nthe BEC-BCS crossover temperature $T_{pair}$, which is typical for OD films and\nuntwinned YBCO single crystals. $T$* was shown to be independent on $B$,\nwhereas $T_{pair}$ shifts to the low temperature region along with increase of\n$B$, while the maximum value of $\\Delta$*($T_{pair}$) remains practically\nconstant regardless of $B$. It was revealed that as the field increases, the\nlow-temperature maximum near the 3D-2D transition temperature $T_{0}$ is\nblurred and disappears at $B$ > 5 T. Moreover, above the Ginzburg temperature\n$T_{G}$, which limits superconducting fluctuations from below, at $B$ > 0.5 T,\na minimum appears on $\\Delta$*(T) at $T_{min}$, which becomes very pronounced\nwith a further increase in the field. As a result, the overall value of\n$\\Delta$*(T) decreases noticeably most likely due to pair-breaking affect of a\nmagnetic field. A comparison of $\\Delta$*(T) near $T_{c}$ with the Peters-Bauer\ntheory shows that the density of fluctuating Cooper pairs actually decreases\nfrom <<n$_{\\uparrow}$n$_{\\downarrow}$>> $\\approx$ 0.31 at $B$ = 0 to\n<<n$_{\\uparrow}$n$_{\\downarrow}$>> $\\approx$ 0.28 in the field 8 T. The\nobserved behavior of $\\Delta$*(T) around $T_{min}$ is assumed to be due to the\ninfluence of a two-dimensional vortex lattice created by the magnetic field,\nwhich prevents the formation of fluctuating Cooper pairs near $T_{c}$.",

We here present a novel generative visual attribution technique,\none that leverages latent diffusion models in combination with domain-specific\nlarge language models, in order to generate normal counterparts of abnormal\nimages. The discrepancy between the two hence gives rise to a mapping\nindicating the diagnostically-relevant image components. To achieve this, we\ndeploy image priors in conjunction with appropriate conditioning mechanisms in\norder to control the image generative process, including natural language text\nprompts acquired from medical science and applied radiology. We perform\nexperiments and quantitatively evaluate our results on the COVID-19 Radiography\nDatabase containing labelled chest X-rays with differing pathologies via the\nFrechet Inception Distance (FID), Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Multi Scale\nStructural Similarity Metric (MS-SSIM) metrics obtained between real and\ngenerated images.

                "summary": "Twenty-two extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXTs) have now been\ndiscovered from two decades of Chandra data (analyzing ~259 Ms of data), with\n17 associated with distant galaxies (>100 Mpc). Different mechanisms and\nprogenitors have been proposed to explain their properties; nevertheless, after\nanalyzing their timing, spectral parameters, host-galaxy properties, luminosity\nfunction, and volumetric rates, their nature remains uncertain. We interpret a\nsub-sample of nine FXTs that show a plateau or a fast-rise light curve within\nthe framework of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger magnetar model. We fit\ntheir light curves and derive magnetar (magnetic field and initial rotational\nperiod) and ejecta (ejecta mass and opacity) parameters. This model predicts\ntwo zones: an orientation-dependent free zone (where the magnetar spin-down\nX-ray photons escape freely to the observer) and a trapped zone (where the\nX-ray photons are initially obscured and only escape freely once the ejecta\nmaterial becomes optically thin). We argue that six FXTs show properties\nconsistent with the free zone and three FXTs with the trapped zone. This\nsub-sample of FXTs has a similar distribution of magnetic fields and initial\nrotation periods to those inferred for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs),\nsuggesting a possible association. We compare the predicted ejecta emission fed\nby the magnetar emission (called merger-nova) to the optical and near-infrared\nupper limits of two FXTs, XRT 141001 and XRT 210423 where contemporaneous\noptical observations are available. The non-detections place lower limits on\nthe redshifts of XRT 141001 and XRT 210423 of z>1.5 and >0.1, respectively. If\nthe magnetar remnants lose energy via gravitational waves, it should be\npossible to detect similar objects with the current advanced LIGO detectors out\nto a redshift z<0.03, while future GW detectors will be able to detect them out\nto z=0.5.",

                "summary": "Supporting learners in introductory programming assignments at scale is a\nnecessity. This support includes automated feedback on what learners did\nincorrectly. Existing approaches cast the problem as automatically repairing\nlearners' incorrect programs extrapolating the data from an existing correct\nprogram from other learners. However, such approaches are limited because they\nonly compare programs with similar control flow and order of statements. A\npotentially valuable set of repair feedback from flexible comparisons is thus\nmissing. In this paper, we present several modifications to CLARA, a\ndata-driven automated repair approach that is open source, to deal with\nreal-world introductory programs. We extend CLARA's abstract syntax tree\nprocessor to handle common introductory programming constructs. Additionally,\nwe propose a flexible alignment algorithm over control flow graphs where we\nenrich nodes with semantic annotations extracted from programs using operations\nand calls. Using this alignment, we modify an incorrect program's control flow\ngraph to match the correct programs to apply CLARA's original repair process.\nWe evaluate our approach against a baseline on the twenty most popular\nprogramming problems in Codeforces. Our results indicate that flexible\nalignment has a significantly higher percentage of successful repairs at 46%\ncompared to 5% for baseline CLARA.

                "summary": "Compositionally complex materials have demonstrated extraordinary promise for\nstructural robustness in extreme environments. Of these, the most commonly\nthought of are high entropy alloys, where chemical complexity grants uncommon\ncombinations of hardness, ductility, and thermal resilience. In contrast to\nthese metal-metal bonded systems, the addition of ionic and covalent bonding\nhas led to the discovery of high entropy ceramics. These materials also possess\noutstanding structural, thermal, and chemical robustness but with a far greater\nvariety of functional properties which enable access to continuously\ncontrollable magnetic, electronic, and optical phenomena. In this perspective,\nwe outline the potential for high entropy ceramics in functional applications\nunder extreme environments, where intrinsic stability may provide a new path\ntoward inherently hardened device design. Current works on high entropy\ncarbides, actinide bearing ceramics, and high entropy oxides are reviewed in\nthe areas of radiation, high temperature, and corrosion tolerance where the\nrole of local disorder is shown to create pathways toward self-healing and\nstructural robustness. In this context, new strategies for creating future\nelectronic, magnetic, and optical devices to be operated in harsh environments\nare outlined.",

Across three language pairs and two types of\ndivergence defined as the structural difference between the source and the\ntarget, MT is consistently more conservative than HT, with less morphosyntactic\ndiversity, more convergent patterns, and more one-to-one alignments. Through\nanalysis on different decoding algorithms, we attribute this discrepancy to the\nuse of beam search that biases MT towards more convergent patterns. This bias\nis most amplified when the convergent pattern appears around 50% of the time in\ntraining data. Lastly, we show that for a majority of morphosyntactic\ndivergences, their presence in HT is correlated with decreased MT performance,\npresenting a greater challenge for MT systems.",

                "summary": "Linear-Quadratic (LQ) problems that arise in systems and controls include the\nclassical optimal control problems of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in\nboth its deterministic and stochastic forms, as well as $H^\\infty$-analysis\n(the Bounded Real Lemma), the Positive Real Lemma, and general Integral\nQuadratic Constraints (IQCs) tests. We present a unified treatment of all of\nthese problems using an approach which converts linear-quadratic problems to\nmatrix-valued linear-linear problems with a positivity constraint. This is done\nthrough a system representation where the joint state/input covariance (the\nouter product in the deterministic case) matrix is the fundamental object. LQ\nproblems then become infinite-dimensional semidefinite programs, and the key\ntool used is that of linear-conic duality. Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs)\nemerge naturally as conal constraints on dual problems. Riccati equations\ncharacterize extrema of these special LMIs, and therefore provide solutions to\nthe dual problems. The state-feedback structure of all optimal signals in these\nproblems emerge out of alignment (complementary slackness) conditions between\nprimal and dual problems. Perhaps the new insight gained from this approach is\nthat first LMIs, and then second, Riccati equations arise naturally in dual,\nrather than primal problems. Furthermore, while traditional LQ problems are set\nup in $L^2$ spaces of signals, their equivalent covariance-representation\nproblems are most naturally set up in $L^1$ spaces of matrix-valued signals.",

                "summary": "Starting from the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation and Duhamel's principle of\ntime-domain wave equations, we propose novel butterfly-compressed Hadamard\nintegrators for self-adjoint wave equations in both time and frequency domain\nin an inhomogeneous medium. First, we incorporate the leading term of\nHadamard's ansatz into the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation to develop a\nshort-time valid propagator. Second, using the Fourier transform in time, we\nderive the corresponding Eulerian short-time propagator in frequency domain; on\ntop of this propagator, we further develop a time-frequency-time (TFT) method\nfor the Cauchy problem of time-domain wave equations. Third, we further propose\nthe time-frequency-time-frequency (TFTF) method for the corresponding\npoint-source Helmholtz equation, which provides Green's functions of the\nHelmholtz equation for all angular frequencies within a given frequency band.\nFourth, to implement TFT and TFTF methods efficiently, we introduce butterfly\nalgorithms to compress oscillatory integral kernels at different frequencies.\nAs a result, the proposed methods can construct wave field beyond caustics\nimplicitly and advance spatially overturning waves in time naturally with\nquasi-optimal computational complexity and memory usage. Furthermore, once\nconstructed the Hadamard integrators can be employed to solve both time-domain\nwave equations with various initial conditions and frequency-domain wave\nequations with different point sources. Numerical examples for two-dimensional\nwave equations illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.",

This work\nproposes an Age of Information (AoI)-aware threshold-based dynamic frame\nslotted ALOHA (T-DFSA) for contention resolution in random access machine-type\ncommunication networks. Unlike conventional DFSA that maximizes the throughput\nin each frame, the frame length and age-gain threshold in T-DFSA are determined\nto minimize the normalized average AoI reduction of the network in each frame.\nAt the start of each frame in the proposed protocol, the common Access Point\n(AP) stores an estimate of the age-gain distribution of a typical node.\nDepending on the observed status of the slots, age-gains of successful nodes,\nand maximum available AoI, the AP adjusts its estimation in each frame. The\nmaximum available AoI is exploited to derive the maximum possible age-gain at\neach frame and thus, to avoid overestimating the age-gain threshold, which may\nrender T-DFSA unstable. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed T-DFSA compared to the existing\noptimal frame slotted ALOHA, threshold-ALOHA, and age-based thinning protocols\nin a considerable range of update generation rates.",

This data;\nOvertaking on Simulated HighwAys (OSHA) dataset is released to tackle this\nchallenge. To solve this problem, an architecture called SwapTransformer is\ndesigned and implemented as an imitation learning approach on the OSHA dataset.\nMoreover, auxiliary tasks such as future points and car distance network\npredictions are proposed to aid the model in better understanding the\nsurrounding environment. The performance of the proposed solution is compared\nwith a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and multi-head self-attention networks as\nbaselines in a simulation environment. We also demonstrate the performance of\nthe model with and without auxiliary tasks. All models are evaluated based on\ndifferent metrics such as time to finish each lap, number of overtakes, and\nspeed difference with speed limit. The evaluation shows that the\nSwapTransformer model outperforms other models in different traffic densities\nin the inference phase.",

However, most of these\nalgorithms assume accurate estimation of the data distribution, which is\nimpractical for high-dimensional variables such as images. On the other hand,\nmodern deep generative architectures can be trained to sample from\nhigh-dimensional distributions. However, training these networks are typically\nvery costly. Thus, it is desirable to leverage pre-trained models to answer\ncausal queries using such high-dimensional data. To address this, we propose\nmodular training of deep causal generative models that not only makes learning\nmore efficient, but also allows us to utilize large, pre-trained conditional\ngenerative models. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm, Modular-DCM is\nthe first algorithm that, given the causal structure, uses adversarial training\nto learn the network weights, and can make use of pre-trained models to\nprovably sample from any identifiable causal query in the presence of latent\nconfounders. With extensive experiments on the Colored-MNIST dataset, we\ndemonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the baselines.

In this work, we present a novel market framework and\ncharacterise the optimal behaviour of GHG offset credit (OC) market\nparticipants in both single-player and two-player settings. The single player\nsetting is posed as an optimal stopping and control problem, while the\ntwo-player setting is posed as optimal stopping and mixed-Nash equilibria\nproblem. We demonstrate the importance of acting optimally using numerical\nsolutions and Monte Carlo simulations and explore the differences between the\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous players. In both settings, we find that market\nparticipants benefit from optimal OC trading and OC generation.",

                "summary": "In this paper, we report on the magnetic and magnetocaloric features of\nDy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$ (Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$Mn$_2$O$_5$) with $x=$ 0.6, 0.8,\nand 1 series elaborated by sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction and Raman\nmeasurements attest well the high quality of our polycrystalline samples that\ncrystallize in an orthorhombic structure with the Pbam space group. The Raman\nphonon frequencies were carried out and compared with the lattice dynamics\ncalculations to identify the vibrational properties of all detected modes at\nroom temperature. As expected, our magnetic study reveals that the\nmagnetization was enhanced by the substitution of Y$^{3+}$ by Dy$^{3+}$. The\nDy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$ sets the N\\'eel transition [TN (Mn)] in the\ntemperature range going from 40 to 45 K favoring the emergence of a transition\nat a very low temperature due to the long-range ordering of the Dy3+ magnetic\nmoments below 13K [TN (Dy)]. Dual peaks in the magnetic entropy change curve\nare also observed being in good agreement with magnetization data, which\nenlarges the range of application of these materials. On the other hand, a\nlarge magnetocaloric effect is observed close to 13 K which is mainly due the\nordering of Dy$^{3+}$ magnetic moments. Also, the incommensurate\nantiferromagnetic transition of Mn magnetic moment taking place around 40 K\naffects slightly the entropy change. Our refrigerant capacity (RC) findings are\nhigher compared to the average of RC for a, b, c axis of single crystal samples\nas HoMn$_2$O$_5$ and TbMn$_2$O$_5$, which confirms that our polycrystalline\nmaterials stand for promising magnetic refrigerant candidates that can be\ninvested in space technology, hydrogen and helium liquefaction at cryogenic\ntemperature.",

                "summary": "Multiple access (MA) is a crucial part of any wireless system and refers to\ntechniques that make use of the resource dimensions to serve multiple\nusers/devices/machines/services, ideally in the most efficient way. Given the\nneeds of multi-functional wireless networks for integrated communications,\nsensing, localization, computing, coupled with the surge of machine learning /\nartificial intelligence (AI) in wireless networks, MA techniques are expected\nto experience a paradigm shift in 6G and beyond. In this paper, we provide a\ntutorial, survey and outlook of past, emerging and future MA techniques and pay\na particular attention to how wireless network intelligence and\nmulti-functionality will lead to a re-thinking of those techniques. The paper\nstarts with an overview of orthogonal, physical layer multicasting, space\ndomain, power domain, ratesplitting, code domain MAs, and other domains, and\nhighlight the importance of researching universal multiple access to shrink\ninstead of grow the knowledge tree of MA schemes by providing a unified\nunderstanding of MA schemes across all resource dimensions. It then jumps into\nrethinking MA schemes in the era of wireless network intelligence, covering AI\nfor MA such as AI-empowered resource allocation, optimization, channel\nestimation, receiver designs, user behavior predictions, and MA for AI such as\nfederated learning/edge intelligence and over the air computation. We then\ndiscuss MA for network multi-functionality and the interplay between MA and\nintegrated sensing, localization, and communications. We finish with studying\nMA for emerging intelligent applications before presenting a roadmap toward 6G\nstandardization. We also point out numerous directions that are promising for\nfuture research.",

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was used in this study as a\nmodel system since it exhibits a wide array of unique chemical, optical, and\nelectrical properties that make it a prospective material for advanced\nelectronics. To better understand the stability and surface chemistry of h-BN\nduring plasma-assisted processing, we used polycrystalline Cu foils with\nsingle-layer h-BN, grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and tracked in\nreal-time the plasma-induced reduction of the underlying Cu oxide using APXPS\nequipped with 22 kHz 75 W discharge plasma source operating at 13 Pa. Residual\ngas analysis (RGA) mass-spectra were concurrently collected during plasma-XPS\nto track reaction products formed during plasma exposure. A clear reduction of\nCuxO is seen, while an h-BN layer remains intact, suggesting H radical species\ncan attack the exposed and h-BN-covered Cu oxide patches and partially reduce\nthe underlying substrate. In addition to the demonstration and discussion of\nplasma-XPS capabilities, our results indicate the h-BN encapsulated metallic Cu\ninterface might be repaired without significantly damaging the overlaying h-BN,\nwhich is of practical importance for the development of h-BN encapsulated\ndevices and interfaces",

Here, we study the decentralized pumping mechanism in the slime\nmold Physarum polycephalum which is locally triggered by active release,\nuptake, and transport of a chemical solute within the organism's vascular\nnetwork to drive global oscillations.Based on a conceptual network model\ncombining active elasticity and fluid transport we identify a set of\ncontractile modes specific to each network and show that modes corresponding to\nlarge-scale oscillations are preferentially and robustly excited both in model\nsimulations and in experimental data obtained from living Physarum plasmodia.\nThese dominant modes are computed explicitly and shown to drive large-scale\nflows within the organism. Furthermore, Physarum must transport nutrients over\nlong distances. As each mode corresponds to pure shuttle flow, long-range,\ndirected transport must rely on a non-linear coupling beyond harmonic dynamics.\nUsing simulations, we demonstrate that the network's transport capability is\noptimized when two dominant modes are excited at a phase shift of $\\pi/2$,\nresulting in contractile excitations similar to those observed in real\nPhysarum. Our results provide a conceptual framework for understanding active\ndecentralized transport in Physarum and other contractile biological networks,\nsuch as brain vasculature, as well as decentralized transportation networks\nmore generally.",

                "title": "Convergence of boundary layers of chemotaxis models with physical\n  boundary conditions~I: degenerate initial data",
                "summary": "The celebrated experiment of Tuval et al. \\cite{tuval2005bacterial} showed\nthat the bacteria living a water drop can form a thin layer near the air-water\ninterface, where a so-called chemotaxis-fluid system with physical boundary\nconditions was proposed to interpret the mechanism underlying the pattern\nformation alongside numerical simulations. However, the rigorous proof for the\nexistence and convergence of the boundary layer solutions to the proposed model\nstill remains open. This paper shows that the model with physical boundary\nconditions proposed in \\cite{tuval2005bacterial} in one dimension can generate\nboundary layer solution as the oxygen diffusion rate $\\varepsilon>0$ is small.\nSpecifically, we show that the solution of the model with $\\varepsilon>0$ will\nconverge to the solution with $\\varepsilon=0$ (outer-layer solution) plus the\nboundary layer profiles (inner-layer solution) with a sharp transition near the\nboundary as $ \\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$. There are two major difficulties in\nour analysis. First, the global well-posedness of the model is hard to prove\nsince the Dirichlet boundary condition can not contribute to the gradient\nestimates needed for the cross-diffusion structure in the model. Resorting to\nthe technique of taking anti-derivative, we remove the cross-diffusion\nstructure such that the Dirichlet boundary condition can facilitate the needed\nestimates. Second, the outer-layer profile of bacterial density is required to\nbe degenerate at the boundary as $ t \\rightarrow 0 ^{+}$, which makes the\ntraditional cancellation technique incapable. Here we employ the Hardy\ninequality and delicate weighted energy estimates to overcome this obstacle and\nderive the requisite uniform-in-$\\varepsilon$ estimates allowing us to pass the\nlimit $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ to achieve our results.",

                "summary": "LiDAR is used in autonomous driving to provide 3D spatial information and\nenable accurate perception in off-road environments, aiding in obstacle\ndetection, mapping, and path planning. Learning-based LiDAR semantic\nsegmentation utilizes machine learning techniques to automatically classify\nobjects and regions in LiDAR point clouds. Learning-based models struggle in\noff-road environments due to the presence of diverse objects with varying\ncolors, textures, and undefined boundaries, which can lead to difficulties in\naccurately classifying and segmenting objects using traditional geometric-based\nfeatures. In this paper, we address this problem by harnessing the LiDAR\nintensity parameter to enhance object segmentation in off-road environments.\nOur approach was evaluated in the RELLIS-3D data set and yielded promising\nresults as a preliminary analysis with improved mIoU for classes \"puddle\" and\n\"grass\" compared to more complex deep learning-based benchmarks. The\nmethodology was evaluated for compatibility across both Velodyne and Ouster\nLiDAR systems, assuring its cross-platform applicability. This analysis\nadvocates for the incorporation of calibrated intensity as a supplementary\ninput, aiming to enhance the prediction accuracy of learning based semantic\nsegmentation frameworks.\nhttps://github.com/MOONLABIISERB/lidar-intensity-predictor/tree/main",

However, the\nprevailing belief has been that Venus' clouds cannot support life due to the\ncloud chemical composition of concentrated sulfuric acid-a highly aggressive\nsolvent. In this work, we study 20 biogenic amino acids at the range of Venus'\ncloud sulfuric acid concentrations (81% and 98% w/w, the rest water) and\ntemperatures. We find 19 of the biogenic amino acids we tested are either\nunreactive (13 in 98% w/w and 12 in 81% w/w) or chemically modified in the side\nchain only, after four weeks. Our major finding, therefore, is that the amino\nacid backbone remains intact in concentrated sulfuric acid. These findings\nsignificantly broaden the range of biologically relevant molecules that could\nbe components of a biochemistry based on a concentrated sulfuric acid solvent.",

This work introduces a learning method designed\nto address these challenges, along with a scalable transmission scheme that\nefficiently uses a single wireless resource through over-the-air computation.\nTo provide resistance against data heterogeneity, we employ gradient\naggregations. Meanwhile, the impact of interference is minimized through\noptimized receiver normalizing factors. For this, we model a multi-cluster\nwireless network using stochastic geometry, and characterize the mean squared\nerror of the aggregation estimations as a function of the network parameters.\nWe show that despite the interference and the data heterogeneity, the proposed\nscheme achieves high learning accuracy and can significantly outperform the\nconventional hierarchical algorithm.",

Detectors\noperating in the UV usually employ a photon-counting mode of operation. These\ndetectors usually have an image intensifier sensitive to UV photons and a\nreadout mechanism that employs photon counting. The development of readouts for\nthese detectors is resource-intensive and expensive. In this paper, we describe\nthe development of a low-cost UV photon-counting detector processing unit that\nemploys a Raspberry Pi with its in built readout to perform the photon-counting\noperation. Our system can operate in both 3x3 and 5x5 window modes at 30 frames\nper sec (fps), where 5x5 window mode also enables the provision of detection of\ndouble events. The system can be built quickly from readily available\ncustom-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and is thus used in inexpensive CubeSats\nor small satellite missions. This low-cost solution promises to broaden access\nto UV observations, advancing research possibilities in space-based astronomy.",

However, these models have yet to be established for (lean) premixed\nhydrogen flames. While flamelet models exist for laminar thermo-diffusively\nunstable hydrogen flames, for which consideration of curvature effects has\nresulted in improved model predictions, it is still unclear whether these\nmodels are directly applicable to turbulent hydrogen flames. Therefore, a\ndetailed assessment of stretch effects on thermochemical states in a turbulent\nlean premixed hydrogen-air slot flame through finite-rate chemistry simulations\nis conducted. Strain and curvature are examined individually using a\ncomposition space model, revealing their distinct influences on thermochemical\nstates. An a-priori analysis confirms that the previously developed tabulated\nmanifolds fall short of capturing all turbulent flame phenomena, necessitating\na novel manifold incorporating both strain and curvature variations.

                "summary": "Visual obstacle discovery is a key step towards autonomous navigation of\nindoor mobile robots. Successful solutions have many applications in multiple\nscenes. One of the exceptions is the reflective ground. In this case, the\nreflections on the floor resemble the true world, which confuses the obstacle\ndiscovery and leaves navigation unsuccessful. We argue that the key to this\nproblem lies in obtaining discriminative features for reflections and\nobstacles. Note that obstacle and reflection can be separated by the ground\nplane in 3D space. With this observation, we firstly introduce a\npre-calibration based ground detection scheme that uses robot motion to predict\nthe ground plane. Due to the immunity of robot motion to reflection, this\nscheme avoids failed ground detection caused by reflection. Given the detected\nground, we design a ground-pixel parallax to describe the location of a pixel\nrelative to the ground. Based on this, a unified appearance-geometry feature\nrepresentation is proposed to describe objects inside rectangular boxes.\nEventually, based on segmenting by detection framework, an appearance-geometry\nfusion regressor is designed to utilize the proposed feature to discover the\nobstacles. It also prevents our model from concentrating too much on parts of\nobstacles instead of whole obstacles. For evaluation, we introduce a new\ndataset for Obstacle on Reflective Ground (ORG), which comprises 15 scenes with\nvarious ground reflections, a total of more than 200 image sequences and 3400\nRGB images. The pixel-wise annotations of ground and obstacle provide a\ncomparison to our method and other methods. By reducing the misdetection of the\nreflection, the proposed approach outperforms others. The source code and the\ndataset will be available at\nhttps://github.com/XuefengBUPT/IndoorObstacleDiscovery-RG.",

While embedding semiconductor\nquantum dots into hybrid circular Bragg gratings has proven effective, it\nconflicts with $p$-$i$-$n$ diode heterostructures which offer superior\ncoherence. We propose and analyze hybrid circular photonic crystal gratings,\nincorporating air holes to facilitate charge carrier transport without\ncompromising optical properties. Through numerical simulations, a broad cavity\nmode with a Purcell factor of 23 enhancing both exciton and biexciton\ntransitions, and exceptional collection efficiency of 92.4% into an objective\nwith numerical aperture of 0.7 are achieved. Furthermore, our design\ndemonstrates direct coupling efficiency over 90% into a single-mode fiber over\nthe entire telecom C-band. The hybrid circular photonic crystal grating thereby\nemerges as a promising solution for the efficient generation of highly\ncoherent, polarization-entangled photon pairs.",

                "summary": "Multi-label image classification presents a challenging task in many domains,\nincluding computer vision and medical imaging. Recent advancements have\nintroduced graph-based and transformer-based methods to improve performance and\ncapture label dependencies. However, these methods often include complex\nmodules that entail heavy computation and lack interpretability. In this paper,\nwe propose Probabilistic Multi-label Contrastive Learning (ProbMCL), a novel\nframework to address these challenges in multi-label image classification\ntasks. Our simple yet effective approach employs supervised contrastive\nlearning, in which samples that share enough labels with an anchor image based\non a decision threshold are introduced as a positive set. This structure\ncaptures label dependencies by pulling positive pair embeddings together and\npushing away negative samples that fall below the threshold. We enhance\nrepresentation learning by incorporating a mixture density network into\ncontrastive learning and generating Gaussian mixture distributions to explore\nthe epistemic uncertainty of the feature encoder. We validate the effectiveness\nof our framework through experimentation with datasets from the computer vision\nand medical imaging domains. Our method outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art methods while achieving a low computational footprint on both\ndatasets. Visualization analyses also demonstrate that ProbMCL-learned\nclassifiers maintain a meaningful semantic topology.",

                "summary": "We present a comparative study of the molecular gas in two galaxies from the\nLEGUS sample: barred spiral NGC 1313 and flocculent spiral NGC 7793. These two\ngalaxies have similar masses, metallicities, and star formation rates, but NGC\n1313 is forming significantly more massive star clusters than NGC 7793,\nespecially young massive clusters (<10 Myr, >10^4 Msol). Using ALMA CO(2-1)\nobservations of the two galaxies with the same sensitivities and resolutions of\n13 pc, we directly compare the molecular gas in these two similar galaxies to\ndetermine the physical conditions responsible for their large disparity in\ncluster formation. By fitting size-linewidth relations for the clouds in each\ngalaxy, we find that NGC 1313 has a higher intercept than NGC 7793, implying\nthat its clouds have higher kinetic energies at a given size scale. NGC 1313\nalso has more clouds near virial equilibrium than NGC 7793, which may be\nconnected to its higher rate of massive cluster formation. However, these\nvirially bound clouds do not show a stronger correlation with young clusters\nthan that of the general cloud population. We find surprisingly small\ndifferences between the distributions of molecular cloud populations in the two\ngalaxies, though the largest of those differences are that NGC 1313 has higher\nsurface densities and lower free-fall times.",

                "summary": "We compare the molecular cloud properties in sub-galactic regions of two\ngalaxies, barred spiral NGC 1313, which is forming many massive clusters, and\nflocculent spiral NGC 7793, which is forming significantly fewer massive\nclusters despite having a similar star formation rate to NGC 1313. We find that\nthere are larger variations in cloud properties between different regions\nwithin each galaxy than there are between the galaxies on a global scale,\nespecially for NGC 1313. There are higher masses, linewidths, pressures, and\nvirial parameters in the arms of NGC 1313 and center of NGC 7793 than in the\ninterarm and outer regions of the galaxies. The massive cluster formation of\nNGC 1313 may be driven by its greater variation in environments, allowing more\nclouds with the necessary conditions to arise, although no one parameter seems\nprimarily responsible for the difference in star formation. Meanwhile NGC 7793\nhas clouds that are as massive and have as much kinetic energy as clouds in the\narms of NGC 1313, but have densities and pressures more similar to the interarm\nregions and so are less inclined to collapse and form stars. The cloud\nproperties in NGC 1313 and NGC 7793 suggest that spiral arms, bars, interarm\nregions, and flocculent spirals each represent distinct environments with\nregard to molecular cloud populations. We see surprisingly little difference in\nsurface densities between the regions, suggesting that the differences in\nsurface densities frequently seen between arm and interarm regions of\nlower-resolution studies are indicative of the sparsity of molecular clouds,\nrather than differences in their true surface density.",

                "summary": "The European Space Agency's Euclid mission is one of the upcoming generation\nof large-scale cosmology surveys, which will map the large-scale structure in\nthe Universe with unprecedented precision. The development and validation of\nthe SGS pipeline requires state-of-the-art simulations with a high level of\ncomplexity and accuracy that include subtle instrumental features not accounted\nfor previously as well as faster algorithms for the large-scale production of\nthe expected Euclid data products. In this paper, we present the Euclid SGS\nsimulation framework as applied in a large-scale end-to-end simulation exercise\nnamed Science Challenge 8. Our simulation pipeline enables the swift production\nof detailed image simulations for the construction and validation of the Euclid\nmission during its qualification phase and will serve as a reference throughout\noperations. Our end-to-end simulation framework starts with the production of a\nlarge cosmological N-body & mock galaxy catalogue simulation. We perform a\nselection of galaxies down to I_E=26 and 28 mag, respectively, for a Euclid\nWide Survey spanning 165 deg^2 and a 1 deg^2 Euclid Deep Survey. We build\nrealistic stellar density catalogues containing Milky Way-like stars down to\nH<26. Using the latest instrumental models for both the Euclid instruments and\nspacecraft as well as Euclid-like observing sequences, we emulate with high\nfidelity Euclid satellite imaging throughout the mission's lifetime. We present\nthe SC8 data set consisting of overlapping visible and near-infrared Euclid\nWide Survey and Euclid Deep Survey imaging and low-resolution spectroscopy\nalong with ground-based. This extensive data set enables end-to-end testing of\nthe entire ground segment data reduction and science analysis pipeline as well\nas the Euclid mission infrastructure, paving the way to future scientific and\ntechnical developments and enhancements.",

                "summary": "We introduce the entangled quantum polynomial hierarchy $\\mathsf{QEPH}$ as\nthe class of problems that are efficiently verifiable given alternating quantum\nproofs that may be entangled with each other. We prove $\\mathsf{QEPH}$\ncollapses to its second level. In fact, we show that a polynomial number of\nalternations collapses to just two. As a consequence, $\\mathsf{QEPH} =\n\\mathsf{QRG(1)}$, the class of problems having one-turn quantum refereed games,\nwhich is known to be contained in $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$. This is in contrast to the\nunentangled quantum polynomial hierarchy $\\mathsf{QPH}$, which contains\n$\\mathsf{QMA(2)}$.\n  We also introduce a generalization of the quantum-classical polynomial\nhierarchy $\\mathsf{QCPH}$ where the provers send probability distributions over\nstrings (instead of strings) and denote it by $\\mathsf{DistributionQCPH}$.\nConceptually, this class is intermediate between $\\mathsf{QCPH}$ and\n$\\mathsf{QPH}$. We prove $\\mathsf{DistributionQCPH} = \\mathsf{QCPH}$,\nsuggesting that only quantum superposition (not classical probability)\nincreases the computational power of these hierarchies. To prove this equality,\nwe generalize a game-theoretic result of Lipton and Young (1994) which says\nthat the provers can send distributions that are uniform over a polynomial-size\nsupport. We also prove the analogous result for the polynomial hierarchy, i.e.,\n$\\mathsf{DistributionPH} = \\mathsf{PH}$. These results also rule out certain\napproaches for showing $\\mathsf{QPH}$ collapses.\n  Finally, we show that $\\mathsf{PH}$ and $\\mathsf{QCPH}$ are contained in\n$\\mathsf{QPH}$, resolving an open question of Gharibian et al.

High-quality\ndatasets are fundamental for developing reliable autonomous driving algorithms.\nPrevious dataset surveys either focused on a limited number or lacked detailed\ninvestigation of dataset characteristics. To this end, we present an exhaustive\nstudy of 265 autonomous driving datasets from multiple perspectives, including\nsensor modalities, data size, tasks, and contextual conditions. We introduce a\nnovel metric to evaluate the impact of datasets, which can also be a guide for\ncreating new datasets. Besides, we analyze the annotation processes, existing\nlabeling tools, and the annotation quality of datasets, showing the importance\nof establishing a standard annotation pipeline. On the other hand, we\nthoroughly analyze the impact of geographical and adversarial environmental\nconditions on the performance of autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we\nexhibit the data distribution of several vital datasets and discuss their pros\nand cons accordingly. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and the\ndevelopment trend of the future autonomous driving datasets.",

                "summary": "The notions of Hausdorff and Fourier dimensions are ubiquitous in harmonic\nanalysis and geometric measure theory. It is known that any hypersurface in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ has Hausdorff dimension $d$. However, the Fourier dimension\ndepends on the finer geometric properties of the hypersurface. For instance,\nthe Fourier dimension of a hyperplane is 0, and the Fourier dimension of a\nhypersurface with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature is $d$. Recently, Harris has\nshown that the Euclidean light cone in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ has Fourier dimension\n$d-1$, which leads one to conjecture that the Fourier dimension of a\nhypersurface equals the number of non-vanishing principal curvatures. We prove\nthis conjecture for all $d$-dimensional cones and cylinders in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ generated by hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with\nnon-vanishing Gaussian curvature. In particular, cones and cylinders are not\nSalem. Our method involves substantial generalizations of Harris's strategy.",

We introduce two variations of an image-guided latent diffusion\nmodel utilizing different image tokens from the pre-trained CLIP image encoder\nand propose corresponding manipulation methods to adjust their results\nsequentially using weighted text inputs.

                "summary": "Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used in always-on safety-critical\napplications deployed on hardware accelerators (NN-HAs) employing various\nmemory technologies. Reliable continuous operation of NN is essential for\nsafety-critical applications. During online operation, NNs are susceptible to\nsingle and multiple permanent and soft errors due to factors such as radiation,\naging, and thermal effects. Explicit NN-HA testing methods cannot detect\ntransient faults during inference, are unsuitable for always-on applications,\nand require extensive test vector generation and storage. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose the \\emph{uncertainty fingerprint} approach representing the\nonline fault status of NN. Furthermore, we propose a dual head NN topology\nspecifically designed to produce uncertainty fingerprints and the primary\nprediction of the NN in \\emph{a single shot}. During the online operation, by\nmatching the uncertainty fingerprint, we can concurrently self-test NNs with up\nto $100\\%$ coverage with a low false positive rate while maintaining a similar\nperformance of the primary task. Compared to existing works, memory overhead is\nreduced by up to $243.7$ MB, multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation is reduced\nby up to $10000\\times$, and false-positive rates are reduced by up to $89\\%$.",

This\nembedding preserves specific low-dimensional structures within the Wasserstein\nspace while constructing a classifier to distinguish between various classes of\npoint clouds. Our approach is motivated by the observation that $L^2-$distances\nbetween optimal transport maps for distinct point clouds, originating from a\nshared fixed reference distribution, provide an approximation of the\nWasserstein-2 distance between these point clouds, under certain assumptions.\nTo learn approximations of these transport maps, we employ input convex neural\nnetworks (ICNNs) and establish that, under specific conditions, Euclidean\ndistances between samples from these ICNNs closely mirror Wasserstein-2\ndistances between the true distributions. Additionally, we train a\ndiscriminator network that attaches weights these samples and creates a\npermutation invariant classifier to differentiate between different classes of\npoint clouds. We showcase the advantages of our algorithm over the standard\ndeep set approach through experiments on a flow cytometry dataset with a\nlimited number of labeled point clouds.",

                "summary": "DSLR cameras can achieve multiple zoom levels via shifting lens distances or\nswapping lens types. However, these techniques are not possible on smartphone\ndevices due to space constraints. Most smartphone manufacturers adopt a hybrid\nzoom system: commonly a Wide (W) camera at a low zoom level and a Telephoto (T)\ncamera at a high zoom level. To simulate zoom levels between W and T, these\nsystems crop and digitally upsample images from W, leading to significant\ndetail loss. In this paper, we propose an efficient system for hybrid zoom\nsuper-resolution on mobile devices, which captures a synchronous pair of W and\nT shots and leverages machine learning models to align and transfer details\nfrom T to W. We further develop an adaptive blending method that accounts for\ndepth-of-field mismatches, scene occlusion, flow uncertainty, and alignment\nerrors. To minimize the domain gap, we design a dual-phone camera rig to\ncapture real-world inputs and ground-truths for supervised training. Our method\ngenerates a 12-megapixel image in 500ms on a mobile platform and compares\nfavorably against state-of-the-art methods under extensive evaluation on\nreal-world scenarios.",

                "summary": "We introduce the notion of quota trees in directed graphs. Given a\nnonnegative integer ``quota'' for each vertex of a directed multigraph $G$, a\nquota tree is an immersed rooted tree which hits each vertex of $G$ the\nprescribed number of times. When the quotas are all one, the tree is actually\nembedded and we recover the usual notion of a spanning arborescence (directed\nspanning tree). The usual algorithms which produce spanning arborescences with\nvarious properties typically have (sometimes more complicated) ``quota''\nanalogues.\n  Our original motivation for studying quota trees was the problem of\ncharacterizing the sizes of the Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes in a\nconnected deterministic finite-state automaton recognizing a given regular\nlanguage. We show that the obstruction to realizing a given set of M-N class\nsizes is precisely the existence of a suitable quota tree.\n  In this paper we develop the basic theory of quota trees. We give necessary\nand sufficient conditions for the existence of a quota tree (or forest) over a\ngiven directed graph with specified quotas, solving the M-N class size problem\nas a special case. We discuss some potential applications of quota trees and\nforests, and connect them to the $k$ lightest paths problem. We give two proofs\nof the main theorem: one based on an algorithmic loop invariant, and one based\non direct enumeration of quota trees. For the latter, we use Lagrange inversion\nto derive a formula which vastly generalizes both the matrix-tree theorem and\nCayley's formula for counting labeled trees. We give an efficient algorithm to\nsample uniformly from the set of forests with given quotas, as well as a\ngeneralization of Edmonds' algorithm for computing a minimum-weight quota\nforest.",

In this study, we demonstrate that an interplay of competing\nquantum effects control the high triplet quantum yield in a prototypical boron\ndipyrromethene-anthracene (BD-An) donor-acceptor dyad photosensitizer, which is\nonly captured by an accurate treatment of both inner and outer sphere\nreorganization energies. Our ab initio-derived model provides excellent\nagreement with experimentally measured spectra, triplet yields and excited\nstate kinetic data, including the triplet lifetime. We find that rapid triplet\nstate formation occurs primarily via high-energy triplet states through both\nspin-orbit coupled charge transfer and El-Sayed's rule breaking intersystem\ncrossing, rather than direct spin-orbit coupled charge transfer to the lowest\nlying triplet state. Our calculations also reveal that competing effects of\nnuclear tunneling, electronic state recrossing, and electronic polarizability\ndictate the rate of non-productive ground state recombination. This study sheds\nlight on the quantum effects driving efficient triplet formation in the BD-An\nsystem, and offers a promising simulation methodology for diverse photochemical\nsystems.",

By confronting the monovalent\nion activity and pressure predictions of our cumulant-corrected DH (CCDH)\ntheory with hypernetted-chain results and Monte-Carlo simulations from the\nliterature, we show that this rectification extends the accuracy of the DH\nformalism from submolar into molar salt concentrations. In the case of internal\nenergies or the general case of divalent electrolytes mainly governed by charge\ncorrelations, the improved accuracy of the CCDH theory is limited to submolar\nion concentrations. Comparison with experimental data from the literature shows\nthat via the adjustment of the hydrated ion radii, the CCDH formalism can\nequally reproduce the non-uniform effect of salt increment on the ionic\nactivity coefficients up to molar concentrations. The inequality satisfied by\nthese HC sizes coincides with the cationic branch of the Hofmeister series.",

More importantly, utilizing the high signal-to-noise ratio and repeated\nobservations of the planet, we identify the following unambiguous time-varying\nsignals in the data: i) a shift of the putative hotspot offset between the two\nphase-curves and ii) varying spectral signatures in the transits and eclipses.\nBy simulating the global dynamics of WASP-121 b atmosphere at high-resolution,\nwe show that the identified signals are consistent with quasi-periodic weather\npatterns, hence atmospheric variability, with signatures at the level probed by\nthe observations (~5% to ~10%) that change on a timescale of ~5 planet days; in\nthe simulations, the weather patterns arise from the formation and movement of\nstorms and fronts, causing hot (as well as cold) patches of atmosphere to\ndeform, separate, and mix in time.",

In this paper, we present interferometric observations taken of directly\nimaged planet host 51 Eridani at the CHARA Array. We measure the limb-darkened\nangular diameter of HD 29391 to be $\\theta_{\\rm LD} = 0.450\\pm 0.006 \\rm ~mas$\nand combining with the Gaia zero-point corrected parallax, we get a stellar\nradius of $1.45 \\pm 0.02 \\rm~R_{\\odot}$. We use the PARSEC isochrones to\nestimate an age of $23.2^{+1.7}_{-2.0} \\rm ~Myr$ and a mass of\n$1.550^{+0.006}_{-0.005}\\rm ~M_{\\odot}$. The age and mass agree well with\nvalues in the literature, determined through a variety of methods ranging from\ndynamical age trace-backs to lithium depletion boundary methods. We derive a\nmass of $4.1 \\pm 0.4\\rm ~M_{Jup}$ for 51 Eri b using the Sonora Bobcat models,\nwhich further supports the possibility of 51 Eri b forming under either the\nhot-start formation model or the warm-start formation model.",

                "summary": "Summarization of electronic health records (EHRs) can substantially minimize\n'screen time' for both patients as well as medical personnel. In recent years\nsummarization of EHRs have employed machine learning pipelines using state of\nthe art neural models. However, these models have produced less than adequate\nresults that are attributed to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient annotated\ndata for training. Moreover, the requirement to consider the entire content of\nan EHR in summarization has resulted in poor performance due to the fact that\nattention mechanisms in modern large language models (LLMs) adds a quadratic\ncomplexity in terms of the size of the input. We propose here a method that\nmitigates these shortcomings by combining semantic search, retrieval augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and question-answering using the latest LLMs. In our approach\nsummarization is the extraction of answers to specific questions that are\ndeemed important by subject-matter experts (SMEs). Our approach is quite\nefficient; requires minimal to no training; does not suffer from the\n'hallucination' problem of LLMs; and it ensures diversity, since the summary\nwill not have repeated content but diverse answers to specific questions.",

                "summary": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved promising results on a variety of\nComputer Vision tasks, however their quadratic complexity in the number of\ninput tokens has limited their application specially in resource-constrained\nsettings. Previous approaches that employ gradual token reduction to address\nthis challenge assume that token redundancy in one layer implies redundancy in\nall the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is\noften not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful\nin later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token\npropagation controller (TPC) that incorporates two different\ntoken-distributions, i.e., pause probability and restart probability to control\nthe reduction and reuse of tokens respectively, which results in more efficient\ntoken utilization. To improve the estimates of token distributions, we propose\na smoothing mechanism that acts as a regularizer and helps remove noisy\noutliers. Furthermore, to improve the training-stability of our proposed TPC,\nwe introduce a model stabilizer that is able to implicitly encode local image\nstructures and minimize accuracy fluctuations during model training. We present\nextensive experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset using DeiT, LV-ViT\nand Swin models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For\nexample, compared to baseline models, our proposed method improves the\ninference speed of the DeiT-S by 250% while increasing the classification\naccuracy by 1.0%.",

                "summary": "Context: Navigating the knowledge of Stack Overflow (SO) remains challenging.\nTo make the posts vivid to users, SO allows users to write and edit posts with\nMarkdown or HTML so that users can leverage various formatting styles (e.g.,\nbold, italic, and code) to highlight the important information. Nonetheless,\nthere have been limited studies on the highlighted information. Objective: We\ncarried out the first large-scale exploratory study on the information\nhighlighted in SO answers in our recent study. To extend our previous study, we\ndevelop approaches to automatically recommend highlighted content with\nformatting styles using neural network architectures initially designed for the\nNamed Entity Recognition task. Method: In this paper, we studied 31,169,429\nanswers of Stack Overflow. For training recommendation models, we choose\nCNN-based and BERT-based models for each type of formatting (i.e., Bold,\nItalic, Code, and Heading) using the information highlighting dataset we\ncollected from SO answers. Results: Our models achieve a precision ranging from\n0.50 to 0.72 for different formatting types. It is easier to build a model to\nrecommend Code than other types. Models for text formatting types (i.e.,\nHeading, Bold, and Italic) suffer low recall. Our analysis of failure cases\nindicates that the majority of the failure cases are due to missing\nidentification. One explanation is that the models are easy to learn the\nfrequent highlighted words while struggling to learn less frequent words (i.g.,\nlong-tail knowledge). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that it is possible to\ndevelop recommendation models for highlighting information for answers with\ndifferent formatting styles on Stack Overflow.",

                "summary": "Speaker representation learning is critical for modern voice recognition\nsystems. While supervised learning techniques require extensive labeled data,\nunsupervised methodologies can leverage vast unlabeled corpora, offering a\nscalable solution. This paper introduces self-supervised reflective learning\n(SSRL), a novel paradigm that streamlines existing iterative unsupervised\nframeworks. SSRL integrates self-supervised knowledge distillation with online\nclustering to refine pseudo labels and train the model without iterative\nbottlenecks. Specifically, a teacher model continually refines pseudo labels\nthrough online clustering, providing dynamic supervision signals to train the\nstudent model. The student model undergoes noisy student training with input\nand model noise to boost its modeling capacity. The teacher model is updated\nvia an exponential moving average of the student, acting as an ensemble of past\niterations. Further, a pseudo label queue retains historical labels for\nconsistency, and noisy label modeling directs learning towards clean samples.\nExperiments on VoxCeleb show SSRL's superiority over current iterative\napproaches, surpassing the performance of a 5-round method in just a single\ntraining round. Ablation studies validate the contributions of key components\nlike noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues. Moreover, consistent\nimprovements in pseudo labeling and the convergence of cluster counts\ndemonstrate SSRL's effectiveness in deciphering unlabeled data. This work marks\nan important advancement in efficient and accurate speaker representation\nlearning through the novel reflective learning paradigm.",

                "summary": "We present our general-purpose mobile manipulation system consisting of a\ncustom robot platform and key algorithms spanning perception and planning. To\nextensively test the system in the wild and benchmark its performance, we\nchoose a grocery shopping scenario in an actual, unmodified grocery store. We\nderive key performance metrics from detailed robot log data collected during\nsix week-long field tests, spread across 18 months. These objective metrics,\ngained from complex yet repeatable tests, drive the direction of our research\nefforts and let us continuously improve our system's performance. We find that\nthorough end-to-end system-level testing of a complex mobile manipulation\nsystem can serve as a reality-check for state-of-the-art methods in robotics.\nThis effectively grounds robotics research efforts in real world needs and\nchallenges, which we deem highly useful for the advancement of the field. To\nthis end, we share our key insights and takeaways to inspire and accelerate\nsimilar system-level research projects.",

We show, along the lines of the\nparameterization method (Cabr\\'e et al., 2003), the existence of a $C^r$\ninvariant foliation tangent to $X_1$ at $x$, for an arbitrary $D\n\\varphi_t(x)$-invariant subspace $X_1 \\subset X$ satisfying some additional\nspectral conditions. Uniqueness ensues in a subclass of sufficiently smooth\ninvariant foliations tangent to $X_1$ at $x$. We then draw relations to Koopman\ntheory, and thereby establish the existence and uniqueness, in some appropriate\nsense, of $C^r$ Koopman eigenfunctions. We demonstrate that these results apply\nto the case of the Navier-Stokes system, the archetypal example considered by\nthe modern upheaval of applied 'Koopmanism'.",

We introduce a generalized vertex-stretching operation that appears\nto be promising in generating $\\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs and study its\nproperties. We also provide several new $\\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs, most\nnotably the first known instances of $12$-vertex graphs with $\\text{LS}_+$-rank\n$4$, which provides the first advance in this direction since Escalante,\nMontelar, and Nasini's discovery of a $9$-vertex graph with $\\text{LS}_+$-rank\n$3$ in 2006.",

Each observed pulse occurs when the white dwarf transits in front\nof its companion star, gravitationally lensing the star's surface, thus making\nit appear brighter to a distant observer. These two pulses are the very first\nself-lensing events discovered in TESS observations. We describe the methods by\nwhich the data were acquired and detrended, as well as the best-fit binary\nparameters deduced from our self-lensing+radial velocity model.

Cross-validation gives an unbiased estimate of the risk (for\nthe present sample size n) with a given penalty parameter, and this function\ncan be minimized as a function of the penalty parameter. Least-squares\ncross-validation, which has been proposed for the similar Deconvoluting Kernel\nDensity Estimator (DKDE), performs quite poorly for SPeD. We instead estimate\nthe risk function for a smaller sample size n_1 < n with a given penalty\nparameter, using this to choose the penalty parameter for sample size n_1, and\nthen use the asymptotics of the optimal penalty parameter to choose for sample\nsize n. In a simulation study, we find that this has dramatically better\nperformance than cross-validation, is an improvement over a SURE-type method\npreviously proposed for this estimator, and compares favorably to the classic\nDKDE with its recommended plug-in method. We prove that the maximum error in\nestimating the risk function is of smaller order than its optimal rate of\nconvergence.",

Transformer-based U-Net architectures, despite their success in\nmedical image segmentation, have limitations in both expressiveness and\ncomputation efficiency in time series forecasting as evidenced in YFormer. To\ntackle these challenges, we introduce Kernel-U-Net, a flexible and\nkernel-customizable U-shape neural network architecture. The kernel-U-Net\nencoder compresses the input series into latent vectors, and its symmetric\ndecoder subsequently expands these vectors into output series. Specifically,\nKernel-U-Net separates the procedure of partitioning input time series into\npatches from kernel manipulation, thereby providing the convenience of\ncustomized executing kernels. Our method offers two primary advantages: 1)\nFlexibility in kernel customization to adapt to specific datasets; and 2)\nEnhanced computational efficiency, with the complexity of the Transformer layer\nreduced to linear. Experiments on seven real-world datasets, demonstrate that\nKernel-U-Net's performance either exceeds or meets that of the existing\nstate-of-the-art model in the majority of cases in channel-independent\nsettings. The source code for Kernel-U-Net will be made publicly available for\nfurther research and application.",

                "summary": "One of the most critical applications undertaken by coalitions of Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is reaching\npredefined targets by following the most time-efficient routes while avoiding\ncollisions. Unfortunately, UAVs are hampered by limited battery life, and UGVs\nface challenges in reachability due to obstacles and elevation variations.\nExisting literature primarily focuses on one-to-one coalitions, which\nconstrains the efficiency of reaching targets. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel approach for a UAV-UGV coalition with a variable number of vehicles,\nemploying a modified mean-shift clustering algorithm to segment targets into\nmultiple zones. Each vehicle utilizes Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (MADDPG) and Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), two\nadvanced reinforcement learning algorithms, to form an effective coalition for\nnavigating obstructed environments without collisions. This approach of\nassigning targets to various circular zones, based on density and range,\nsignificantly reduces the time required to reach these targets. Moreover,\nintroducing variability in the number of UAVs and UGVs in a coalition enhances\ntask efficiency by enabling simultaneous multi-target engagement. The results\nof our experimental evaluation demonstrate that our proposed method\nsubstantially surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques, nearly doubling\nefficiency in terms of target navigation time and task completion rate.",

                "summary": "The Evidential Regression Network (ERN) represents a novel approach that\nintegrates deep learning with Dempster-Shafer's theory to predict a target and\nquantify the associated uncertainty. Guided by the underlying theory, specific\nactivation functions must be employed to enforce non-negative values, which is\na constraint that compromises model performance by limiting its ability to\nlearn from all samples. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of this\nlimitation and introduces an improvement to overcome it. Initially, we define\nthe region where the models can't effectively learn from the samples. Following\nthis, we thoroughly analyze the ERN and investigate this constraint. Leveraging\nthe insights from our analysis, we address the limitation by introducing a\nnovel regularization term that empowers the ERN to learn from the whole\ntraining set. Our extensive experiments substantiate our theoretical findings\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",

The protocols for\nmeasuring the degree of indistinguishability conventionally require\nphoton-coincidence measurements at several different time or phase delays,\nwhich is a fundamental bottleneck towards the fast measurements and real-time\nmonitoring of indistinguishability. Here, we develop a static dielectric\nmetasurface grating without any reconfigurable elements that realizes a\ntailored multiport transformation in the free-space configuration without the\nneed for phase locking and enables single-shot characterization of the\nindistinguishability between two photons in multiple degrees of freedom\nincluding time, spectrum, spatial modes, and polarization. Topology\noptimization is employed to design a silicon metasurface with polarization\nindependence, high transmission, and high tolerance to measurement noise. We\nfabricate the metasurface and experimentally quantify the indistinguishability\nof photons in the time domain with fidelity over 98.4\\%. We anticipate that the\ndeveloped framework based on ultrathin metasurfaces can be further extended for\nmulti-photon states and additional degrees of freedom associated with spatial\nmodalities.",

We resolve a sequence\nof first-order phase transitions between completely spin-polarized LLs and\nstates with LLs of both spins. Unexpectedly, the LL gaps are roughly constant\nover a wide range of magnetic fields below the transitions, which we show\nreflects a preference for opposite spin excitations of the spin-polarized\nground state. These transitions also extend into compressible regimes, with a\nsawtooth boundary between full and partial spin polarization. We link these\nobservations to the important influence of LL filling on the exchange energy\nbeyond a smooth density-dependent contribution.

                "summary": "PSR J1012+5307 is a millisecond pulsar with an extremely low-mass (ELM) white\ndwarf (WD) companion in an orbit of 14.5 hours. Magnetic braking (MB) plays an\nimportant role in influencing the orbital evolution of binary systems with a\nlow-mass ($\\lt 1-2~M_{\\odot}$) donor star. At present, there exist several\ndifferent MB descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the formation of PSR\nJ1012+5307 as a probe to test the plausible MB model. Employing a detailed\nstellar evolution model by the MESA code, we find that the Convection And\nRotation Boosted MB and the 'Intermediate' MB models can reproduce the WD mass,\nWD radius, WD surface gravity, neutron-star mass, and orbital period observed\nin PSR J1012+5307. However, our simulated WD has higher effective temperature\nthan the observation. Other three MB mechanisms including the standard MB model\nare too weak to account for the observed orbital period in a Hubble time. A\nlong cooling timescale caused by H-shell flashes of the WD may alleviate the\ndiscrepancy between the simulated effective temperature and the observed value.",

This study extends the\ncurrent normative models, which primarily optimize prediction, by\nconceptualizing neurons as optimal feedback controllers. We posit that neurons,\nespecially those beyond early sensory areas, act as controllers, steering their\nenvironment towards a specific desired state through their output. This\nenvironment comprises both synaptically interlinked neurons and external motor\nsensory feedback loops, enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their\ncontrol via synaptic feedback. Utilizing the novel Direct Data-Driven Control\n(DD-DC) framework, we model neurons as biologically feasible controllers which\nimplicitly identify loop dynamics, infer latent states and optimize control.\nOur DD-DC neuron model explains various neurophysiological phenomena: the shift\nfrom potentiation to depression in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)\nwith its asymmetry, the duration and adaptive nature of feedforward and\nfeedback neuronal filters, the imprecision in spike generation under constant\nstimulation, and the characteristic operational variability and noise in the\nbrain. Our model presents a significant departure from the traditional,\nfeedforward, instant-response McCulloch-Pitts-Rosenblatt neuron, offering a\nnovel and biologically-informed fundamental unit for constructing neural\nnetworks.",

Metasurfaces can help\nminiaturize chiral devices but only produce static and limited chiral\nresponses. While external stimuli are able to tune resonances, their\nmodulations are often weak, and reversing continuously the sign of circular\ndichroism is extremely challenging. Here, we demonstrate dynamically tunable\nchiral response of resonant metasurfaces supporting chiral bound states in the\ncontinuum combining them with phase-change materials. Phase transition between\namorphous and crystalline phases allows to control chiral response and vary\nchirality rapidly from -0.947 to +0.958 backward and forward via chirality\ncontinuum.

                "summary": "This study was groundbreaking in its application of neural network models for\nnitrate management in the Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). A hybrid\nneural network model was proposed, which accurately predicted daily nitrate\nconcentration and its trends using six water quality parameters. We conducted a\n105-day aquaculture experiment, during which we collected 450 samples from five\nsets of RAS to train our model (C-L-A model) which incorporates Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and self-Attention.\nFurthermore, we obtained 90 samples from a standalone RAS as the testing data\nto evaluate the performance of the model in practical applications. The\nexperimental results proved that the C-L-A model accurately predicted nitrate\nconcentration in RAS and maintained good performance even with a reduced\nproportion of training data. We recommend using water quality parameters from\nthe past 7 days to forecast future nitrate concentration, as this timeframe\nallows the model to achieve maximum generalization capability. Additionally, we\ncompared the performance of the C-L-A model with three basic neural network\nmodels (CNN, LSTM, self-Attention) as well as three hybrid neural network\nmodels (CNN-LSTM, CNN-Attention, LSTM-Attention). The results demonstrated that\nthe C-L-A model (R2=0.956) significantly outperformed the other neural network\nmodels (R2=0.901-0.927). Our study suggests that the utilization of neural\nnetwork models, specifically the C-L-A model, could potentially assist the RAS\nindustry in conserving resources for daily nitrate monitoring.",

                "summary": "Remote Sensing Target Fine-grained Classification (TFGC) is of great\nsignificance in both military and civilian fields. Due to location differences,\ngrowth in data size, and centralized server storage constraints, these data are\nusually stored under different databases across regions/countries. However,\nprivacy laws and national security concerns constrain researchers from\naccessing these sensitive remote sensing images for further analysis.\nAdditionally, low-resource remote sensing devices encounter challenges in terms\nof communication overhead and efficiency when dealing with the ever-increasing\ndata and model scales. To solve the above challenges, this paper proposes a\nnovel Privacy-Reserving TFGC Framework based on Federated Learning, dubbed\nPRFL. The proposed framework allows each client to learn global and local\nknowledge to enhance the local representation of private data in environments\nwith extreme statistical heterogeneity (non. Independent and Identically\nDistributed, IID). Thus, it provides highly customized models to clients with\ndifferentiated data distributions. Moreover, the framework minimizes\ncommunication overhead and improves efficiency while ensuring satisfactory\nperformance, thereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability under\nresource-scarce conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nPRFL on the classical TFGC task by leveraging four public datasets.",

                "summary": "In terms of human-computer interaction, it is becoming more and more\nimportant to correctly understand the user's emotional state in a conversation,\nso the task of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) started to receive more\nattention. However, existing emotion classification methods usually perform\nclassification only once. Sentences are likely to be misclassified in a single\nround of classification. Previous work usually ignores the similarities and\ndifferences between different morphological features in the fusion process. To\naddress the above issues, we propose a two-stage emotion recognition model\nbased on graph contrastive learning (TS-GCL). First, we encode the original\ndataset with different preprocessing modalities. Second, a graph contrastive\nlearning (GCL) strategy is introduced for these three modal data with other\nstructures to learn similarities and differences within and between modalities.\nFinally, we use MLP twice to achieve the final emotion classification. This\nstaged classification method can help the model to better focus on different\nlevels of emotional information, thereby improving the performance of the\nmodel. Extensive experiments show that TS-GCL has superior performance on\nIEMOCAP and MELD datasets compared with previous methods.",

                "summary": "Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and accurately\ndistinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid tumors is crucial for\ndeveloping effective treatment plans in clinical practice. Pathologically,\nthyroid tumors pose diagnostic challenges due to improper specimen sampling. In\nthis study, we have designed a three-stage model using representation learning\nto integrate pixel-level and slice-level annotations for distinguishing thyroid\ntumors. This structure includes a pathology structure recognition method to\npredict structures related to thyroid tumors, an encoder-decoder network to\nextract pixel-level annotation information by learning the feature\nrepresentations of image blocks, and an attention-based learning mechanism for\nthe final classification task. This mechanism learns the importance of\ndifferent image blocks in a pathological region, globally considering the\ninformation from each block. In the third stage, all information from the image\nblocks in a region is aggregated using attention mechanisms, followed by\nclassification to determine the category of the region. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method can predict microscopic structures more\naccurately. After color-coding, the method achieves results on unstained\npathology slides that approximate the quality of Hematoxylin and eosin\nstaining, reducing the need for stained pathology slides. Furthermore, by\nleveraging the concept of indirect measurement and extracting polarized\nfeatures from structures correlated with lesions, the proposed method can also\nclassify samples where membrane structures cannot be obtained through sampling,\nproviding a potential objective and highly accurate indirect diagnostic\ntechnique for thyroid tumors.",

                "summary": "Sequential recommenders are crucial to the success of online applications,\n\\eg e-commerce, video streaming, and social media. While model architectures\ncontinue to improve, for every new application domain, we still have to train a\nnew model from scratch for high quality recommendations. On the other hand,\npre-trained language and vision models have shown great success in zero-shot or\nfew-shot adaptation to new application domains. Inspired by the success of\npre-trained models in peer AI fields, we propose a novel pre-trained sequential\nrecommendation framework: PrepRec. We learn universal item representations by\nmodeling item popularity dynamics. Through extensive experiments on five\nreal-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information,\ncan not only zero-shot transfer to a new domain, but achieve competitive\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models with\nonly a fraction of the model size. In addition, with a simple post-hoc\ninterpolation, PrepRec can improve the performance of existing sequential\nrecommenders on average by 13.8\\% in Recall@10 and 29.5% in NDCG@10. We provide\nan anonymized implementation of PrepRec at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/PrepRec--2F60/",

Our approach divides the whole TTS pipeline into semantic-level\nsequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling and fine-grained acoustic modeling\nstages, utilizing discrete semantic tokens obtained from wav2vec2.0 embeddings.\nFor a robust and efficient alignment modeling, we employ a neural transducer\nnamed token transducer for the semantic token prediction, benefiting from its\nhard monotonic alignment constraints. Subsequently, a non-autoregressive (NAR)\nspeech generator efficiently synthesizes waveforms from these semantic tokens.\nAdditionally, a reference speech controls temporal dynamics and acoustic\nconditions at each stage. This decoupled framework reduces the training\ncomplexity of TTS while allowing each stage to focus on semantic and acoustic\nmodeling. Our experimental results on zero-shot adaptive TTS demonstrate that\nour model surpasses the baseline in terms of speech quality and speaker\nsimilarity, both objectively and subjectively. We also delve into the inference\nspeed and prosody control capabilities of our approach, highlighting the\npotential of neural transducers in TTS frameworks.",

As different behavioral assumptions are adopted in different safety\nmetrics, it is difficult to compare the safety metrics and evaluate their\nperformance. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we propose an\nevaluation framework utilizing logged vehicle trajectory data, in that vehicle\ntrajectories for both subject vehicle (SV) and background vehicles (BVs) are\nobtained and the prediction errors caused by behavioral assumptions can be\neliminated. Specifically, we examine whether the SV is in a collision\nunavoidable situation at each moment, given all near-future trajectories of\nBVs. In this way, we level the ground for a fair comparison of different safety\nmetrics, as a good safety metric should always alarm in advance to the\ncollision unavoidable moment. When trajectory data from a large number of trips\nare available, we can systematically evaluate and compare different metrics'\nstatistical performance. In the case study, three representative real-time\nsafety metrics, including the time-to-collision (TTC), the PEGASUS Criticality\nMetric (PCM), and the Model Predictive Instantaneous Safety Metric (MPrISM),\nare evaluated using a large-scale simulated trajectory dataset. The proposed\nevaluation framework is important for researchers, practitioners, and\nregulators to characterize different metrics, and to select appropriate metrics\nfor different applications. Moreover, by conducting failure analysis on moments\nwhen a safety metric failed, we can identify its potential weaknesses which are\nvaluable for its potential refinements and improvements.",

                "summary": "The values of two-player general-sum differential games are viscosity\nsolutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. Value and policy\napproximations for such games suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD).\nAlleviating CoD through physics-informed neural networks (PINN) encounters\nconvergence issues when differentiable values with large Lipschitz constants\nare present due to state constraints. On top of these challenges, it is often\nnecessary to learn generalizable values and policies across a parametric space\nof games, e.g., for game parameter inference when information is incomplete. To\naddress these challenges, we propose in this paper a Pontryagin-mode neural\noperator that outperforms the current state-of-the-art hybrid PINN model on\nsafety performance across games with parametric state constraints. Our key\ncontribution is the introduction of a costate loss defined on the discrepancy\nbetween forward and backward costate rollouts, which are computationally cheap.\nWe show that the costate dynamics, which can reflect state constraint\nviolation, effectively enables the learning of differentiable values with large\nLipschitz constants, without requiring manually supervised data as suggested by\nthe hybrid PINN model. More importantly, we show that the close relationship\nbetween costates and policies makes the former critical in learning feedback\ncontrol policies with generalizable safety performance.",

                "summary": "Specific emitter identification (SEI) technology is significant in device\nadministration scenarios, such as self-organized networking and spectrum\nmanagement, owing to its high security. For nonlinear and non-stationary\nelectromagnetic signals, SEI often employs variational modal decomposition\n(VMD) to decompose the signal in order to effectively characterize the distinct\ndevice fingerprint. However, the trade-off of VMD between the robustness to\nnoise and the ability to preserve signal information has not been investigated\nin the current literature. Moreover, the existing VMD algorithm does not\nutilize the stability of the intrinsic distortion of emitters within a certain\ntemporal span, consequently constraining its practical applicability in SEI. In\nthis paper, we propose a joint variational modal decomposition (JVMD)\nalgorithm, which is an improved version of VMD by simultaneously implementing\nmodal decomposition on multi-frame signals. The consistency of multi-frame\nsignals in terms of the central frequencies and the inherent modal functions\n(IMFs) is exploited, which effectively highlights the distinctive\ncharacteristics among emitters and reduces noise. Additionally, the complexity\nof JVMD is analyzed, which is proven to be more computational-friendly than\nVMD. Simulations of both modal decomposition and SEI that involve real-world\ndatasets are presented to illustrate that when compared with VMD, the JVMD\nalgorithm improves the accuracy of device classification and the robustness\ntowards noise.",

This network generated predictions with a mean\nabsolute error of 15.1 and, in a quantification of the tail of the error\ndistribution, a 95th percentile absolute error of 46.5. Because of the\nArtificial Intelligence Retention Indices (AIRI) network's accuracy, it was\nused to predict RI values for the NIST EI-MS spectral libraries. These RI\nvalues are used to improve chemical identification methods and the quality of\nthe library. Estimating uncertainty is an important practical need when using\nprediction models. To quantify the uncertainty of our network for each\nindividual prediction, we used the outputs of an ensemble of 8 networks to\ncalculate a predicted standard deviation for each RI value prediction. This\npredicted standard deviation was corrected to follow the error between observed\nand predicted RI values. The Z scores using these predicted standard deviations\nhad a standard deviation of 1.52 and a 95th percentile absolute Z score\ncorresponding to a mean RI value of 42.6.",

The delicate interplay among the complex intra-/inter-layer\nelectron-electron and electron-lattice interactions is the fundamental\nprerequisite of these exotic quantum states. Here, we report a real-space\ntitration-like investigation of correlated CDW state in 1T-TaS2 upon\nhole-doping via low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM). The\ngradual increased hole-doping results in the sequential emergence of electron\nvoids, phase domains, stacking disordering and mixed phase/chiral domains\nattributed to the reduced electron correlations. The achiral intermediate\nring-like clusters and nematic CDW states emerge at the intralayer chiral\ndomain wall and interlayer heterochiral stacking regions via the\nchiral-overlapping configurations. The local reversible CDW manipulation is\nfurther realized by the non-equilibrium transient charge-injections of STM\nfield-emission spectra. Our results provide an in-depth insight of this\nintricate correlated CDW state, and pave a way to realize exotic quantum states\nvia the accurate tuning of interior interactions in correlated materials.",

One compelling factor behind the growing adoption of NLP in\nRequirements Engineering (RE) is the prevalent use of natural language (NL) for\nspecifying requirements in industry. NLP techniques are commonly used for\nautomatically classifying requirements, extracting important information, e.g.,\ndomain models and glossary terms, and performing quality assurance tasks, such\nas ambiguity handling and completeness checking. With so many different NLP\nsolution strategies available and the possibility of applying machine learning\nalongside, it can be challenging to choose the right strategy for a specific RE\ntask and to evaluate the resulting solution in an empirically rigorous manner.\nIn this chapter, we present guidelines for the selection of NLP techniques as\nwell as for their evaluation in the context of RE. In particular, we discuss\nhow to choose among different strategies such as traditional NLP, feature-based\nmachine learning, and language-model-based methods. Our ultimate hope for this\nchapter is to serve as a stepping stone, assisting newcomers to NLP4RE in\nquickly initiating themselves into the NLP technologies most pertinent to the\nRE field.",

                "summary": "While significant advancements have been made in video question answering\n(VideoQA), the potential benefits of enhancing model generalization through\ntailored difficulty scheduling have been largely overlooked in existing\nresearch. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by incorporating VideoQA into a\ncurriculum learning (CL) framework that progressively trains models from\nsimpler to more complex data. Recognizing that conventional self-paced CL\nmethods rely on training loss for difficulty measurement, which might not\naccurately reflect the intricacies of video-question pairs, we introduce the\nconcept of uncertainty-aware CL. Here, uncertainty serves as the guiding\nprinciple for dynamically adjusting the difficulty. Furthermore, we address the\nchallenge posed by uncertainty by presenting a probabilistic modeling approach\nfor VideoQA. Specifically, we conceptualize VideoQA as a stochastic computation\ngraph, where the hidden representations are treated as stochastic variables.\nThis yields two distinct types of uncertainty: one related to the inherent\nuncertainty in the data and another pertaining to the model's confidence. In\npractice, we seamlessly integrate the VideoQA model into our framework and\nconduct comprehensive experiments. The findings affirm that our approach not\nonly achieves enhanced performance but also effectively quantifies uncertainty\nin the context of VideoQA.",

                "summary": "The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized information retrieval,\nushering in a new era of expansive knowledge accessibility. While these models\nexcel in providing open-world knowledge, effectively extracting answers in\ndiverse linguistic environments with varying levels of literacy remains a\nformidable challenge. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a\npromising solution, bridging the gap between information availability and\nmultilingual comprehension. However, deploying RAG models in real-world\nscenarios demands careful consideration of various factors. This paper\naddresses the critical challenges associated with implementing RAG models in\nmulticultural environments. We delve into essential considerations, including\ndata feeding strategies, timely updates, mitigation of hallucinations,\nprevention of erroneous responses, and optimization of delivery speed. Our work\ninvolves the integration of a diverse array of tools, meticulously combined to\nfacilitate the seamless adoption of RAG models across languages and literacy\nlevels within a multicultural organizational context. Through strategic tweaks\nin our approaches, we achieve not only effectiveness but also efficiency,\nensuring the accelerated and accurate delivery of information in a manner that\nis tailored to the unique requirements of multilingual and multicultural\nsettings.",

We highlight that relying on accuracy-based\nmeasurements may lead to an overestimation of models' capabilities by\nneglecting the syntax rules of programming languages. To address these issues,\nwe introduce a technique called SyntaxEval in which Syntactic Capabilities are\nused to enhance the evaluation of MLMs. SyntaxEval automates the process of\nmasking elements in the model input based on their Abstract Syntax Trees\n(ASTs). We conducted a case study on two popular MLMs using data from GitHub\nrepositories. Our results showed negative causal effects between the node types\nand MLMs' accuracy. We conclude that MLMs under study fail to predict some\nsyntactic capabilities.",

                "summary": "When ultrasonic wave is irradiated on materials, a small static stress is\nrequired to get materials yielding and flowing. This is called acoustic\nsoftening effect, also known as Blaha effect for a long time. In the past, this\neffect was explained by several continuum scale or meso-scale solid mechanics\ntheories such as stress superposition or energy superposition theory, or\ncrystal/dislocation plasticity. Due to a lot of microscopic complexities\nhappening inside the materials during ultrasonic vibration, fully understanding\nof acoustic softening effect is not easy. In this paper, traditional solid\nmechanics theory is expanded by introducing several concepts in semi-conductor\nphysics. Four new aspects were introduced to understand acoustic softening\neffect. Firstly, contrary to most existed work in acoustic softening research\narea which treats ultrasound as waves, it was treated as particles. Secondly,\ncrystal/dislocation plastic theory was simplified to a single equation.\nThirdly, concepts of photoelectric effect or photo-voltaic effect were\nintroduced. Analogy of electron movement due to light wave and defect movement\ndue to ultrasonic wave was illustrated. Particularly, as light wave is treated\nas photon, ultrasonic wave is treated as phonon in this paper. Fourthly,\ndefects such as point defects or line defects are assumed to have certain\nbonding energy. Their bonding energies are assumed to be quantized or\ndiscontinuous. The band gap theory used in photo-voltaic theory is embraced to\nunderstand defects movements in solid mechanics due to ultrasonic phonon.",

                "summary": "Linear RMS-flux relation has been well established in different spectral\nstates of all accreting systems. In this work, we study the evolution of the\nfrequency-dependent RMS-flux relation of MAXI J1820+070 during the initial\ndecaying phase of the 2018 outburst with Insight-HXMT over a broad energy range\n1-150 keV. As the flux decreases, we first observe a linear RMS-flux relation\nat frequencies from 2 mHz to 10 Hz, while such a relation breaks at varying\ntimes for different energies, leading to a substantial reduction in the slope.\nMoreover, we find that the low-frequency variability exhibits the highest\nsensitivity to the break, which occurs prior to the hard-to-hard state\ntransition time determined through time-averaged spectroscopy, and the time\ndeviation increases with energy. The overall evolution of the RMS-flux slope\nand intercept suggests the presence of a two-component Comptonization system.\nOne component is radially extended, explaining the strong disk-corona coupling\nbefore the break, while the other component extends vertically, contributing to\nthe reduction of the disk-corona coupling after the break. A further vertical\nexpansion of the latter component is required to accommodate the dynamic\nevolution observed in the RMS-flux slope. In conclusion, we suggest that the\nRMS-flux slope in 1-150 keV band can be employed as an indicator of the\ndisk-corona coupling and the hard-to-hard state transition in MAXI J1820+070\ncould be partially driven by the changes in the corona geometry.",

Previous works provided partial results on\nthe price of fairness with well-known fairness notions such as envy-freeness up\nto one good (EF1) and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX). In this paper, we\ngive a complete characterization for the price of envy-freeness in various\nsettings. In particular, we first consider the two-agent case under the\nindivisible-goods setting and present tight ratios for the price of EF1 (for\nscaled utility) and EFX (for unscaled utility), which resolve questions left\nopen in the literature. Next, we consider the mixed goods setting which\nconcerns a mixture of both divisible and indivisible goods. We focus on\nenvy-freeness for mixed goods (EFM), which generalizes both envy-freeness and\nEF1, as well as its strengthening called envy-freeness up to any good for mixed\ngoods (EFXM), which generalizes envy-freeness and EFX. To this end, we settle\nthe price of EFM and EFXM by providing a complete picture of tight bounds for\ntwo agents and asymptotically tight bounds for $n$ agents, for both scaled and\nunscaled utilities.",

                "summary": "To gain a better understanding of the Andromeda galaxy M31 and its role in\nthe Local Group, measuring its mass precisely is essential. In this work, we\nhave constructed the rotation curve of M31 out to $\\sim$125 kpc using 13,679\nM31 objects obtained from various sources, including the LAMOST data release 9\n(LAMOST DR9), the DESI survey, and relevant literature. We divide all objects\nin our sample into bulge, disk and halo components. For the sources in the M31\ndisk, we have measured their circular velocities by a kinematic model with\nasymmetric drift corrections. For the bulge and halo objects, we calculate\ntheir velocity dispersions and use the spherical and projected Jeans equation\nto obtain the circular velocities. Our findings indicate a nearly isotropic\nnature for the M31 bulge, while the halo exhibits tangential anisotropy. The\nresults show that the rotation curve remains constant at $\\sim$220 km s$^{-1}$\nup to radius $\\sim$25 kpc and gradually decreases to $\\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$\nfurther out. Based on the newly determined rotation curve, we have constructed\na mass distribution model for M31. Our measurement of the M31 virial mass is\n$M_{\\rm vir} = 1.14^{+0.51}_{-0.35} \\times 10^{12} M_\\odot$ within $r_{\\rm vir}\n= 220 \\pm 25$ kpc.",

However, these routers impose stringent\nrequirements for achieving desired routing results, as the incident photon\nfrequency must be in strict resonance with one or several specific frequencies.\nTo address this challenge, we propose an efficient quantum router scheme\ncomposed of semi-infinite coupled-resonator waveguide (CRW) and a giant atom.\nThe single-channel router scheme enables stable output with 100% transfer rate\nover the entire energy band of the CRW. Leveraging this intriguing result, we\nfurther propose a multi-channel router scheme that possesses high stability and\nuniversality, while also being capable of performing various functionalities.\nThe complete physical explanation of the underlying mechanism for this\nintriguing result is also presented. We hope that quantum router with output\nresults unaffected by the frequency of the incoming information carriers\npresents a more reliable solution for the implementation of quantum networks.",

Psychology has undergone several theoretical changes,\nand the current use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning,\nparticularly LLMs, promises to open up new research directions. We provide a\ndetailed exploration of how LLMs like ChatGPT are transforming psychological\nresearch. It discusses the impact of LLMs across various branches of\npsychology, including cognitive and behavioral, clinical and counseling,\neducational and developmental, and social and cultural psychology, highlighting\ntheir potential to simulate aspects of human cognition and behavior. The paper\ndelves into the capabilities of these models to emulate human-like text\ngeneration, offering innovative tools for literature review, hypothesis\ngeneration, experimental design, experimental subjects, data analysis, academic\nwriting, and peer review in psychology. While LLMs are essential in advancing\nresearch methodologies in psychology, the paper also cautions about their\ntechnical and ethical challenges. There are issues like data privacy, the\nethical implications of using LLMs in psychological research, and the need for\na deeper understanding of these models' limitations. Researchers should\nresponsibly use LLMs in psychological studies, adhering to ethical standards\nand considering the potential consequences of deploying these technologies in\nsensitive areas. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the\ncurrent state of LLMs in psychology, exploring potential benefits and\nchallenges. It serves as a call to action for researchers to leverage LLMs'\nadvantages responsibly while addressing associated risks.",

A\nsubset of these models, exemplified by DDIMs, exhibit an inherent asymmetry:\nthey are trained over $T$ steps but only sample from a subset of $T$ during\ngeneration. This selective sampling approach, though optimized for speed,\ninadvertently misses out on vital information from the unsampled steps, leading\nto potential compromises in sample quality. To address this issue, we present\nthe S$^{2}$-DMs, which is a new training method by using an innovative\n$L_{skip}$, meticulously designed to reintegrate the information omitted during\nthe selective sampling phase. The benefits of this approach are manifold: it\nnotably enhances sample quality, is exceptionally simple to implement, requires\nminimal code modifications, and is flexible enough to be compatible with\nvarious sampling algorithms. On the CIFAR10 dataset, models trained using our\nalgorithm showed an improvement of 3.27% to 14.06% over models trained with\ntraditional methods across various sampling algorithms (DDIMs, PNDMs, DEIS) and\ndifferent numbers of sampling steps (10, 20, ..., 1000). On the CELEBA dataset,\nthe improvement ranged from 8.97% to 27.08%. Access to the code and additional\nresources is provided in the github.",

                "summary": "Quantum computing offers significant acceleration capabilities over its\nclassical counterpart in various application domains. Consequently, there has\nbeen substantial focus on improving quantum computing capabilities. However, to\ndate, the security implications of these quantum computing platforms have been\nlargely overlooked. With the emergence of cloud-based quantum computing\nservices, it is critical to investigate the extension of classical computer\nsecurity threats to the realm of quantum computing.\n  In this study, we investigated timing-based side-channel vulnerabilities\nwithin IBM's cloud-based quantum service. The proposed attack effectively\nsubverts the confidentiality of the executed quantum algorithm, using a more\nrealistic threat model compared to existing approaches. Our experimental\nresults, conducted using IBM's quantum cloud service, demonstrate that with\njust 10 measurements, it is possible to identify the underlying quantum\ncomputer that executed the circuit. Moreover, when evaluated using the popular\nGrover circuit, we showcase the ability to leak the quantum oracle with a mere\n500 measurements. These findings underline the pressing need to address\ntiming-based vulnerabilities in quantum computing platforms and advocate for\nenhanced security measures to safeguard sensitive quantum algorithms and data.",

                "summary": "Table structure recognition (TSR) aims at extracting tables in images into\nmachine-understandable formats. Recent methods solve this problem by predicting\nthe adjacency relations of detected cell boxes or learning to directly generate\nthe corresponding markup sequences from the table images. However, existing\napproaches either count on additional heuristic rules to recover the table\nstructures, or face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies within\ntables, resulting in increased complexity. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative paradigm. We model TSR as a logical location regression problem and\npropose a new TSR framework called LORE, standing for LOgical location\nREgression network, which for the first time regresses logical location as well\nas spatial location of table cells in a unified network. Our proposed LORE is\nconceptually simpler, easier to train, and more accurate than other paradigms\nof TSR. Moreover, inspired by the persuasive success of pre-trained models on a\nnumber of computer vision and natural language processing tasks, we propose two\npre-training tasks to enrich the spatial and logical representations at the\nfeature level of LORE, resulting in an upgraded version called LORE++. The\nincorporation of pre-training in LORE++ has proven to enjoy significant\nadvantages, leading to a substantial enhancement in terms of accuracy,\ngeneralization, and few-shot capability compared to its predecessor.\nExperiments on standard benchmarks against methods of previous paradigms\ndemonstrate the superiority of LORE++, which highlights the potential and\npromising prospect of the logical location regression paradigm for TSR.",

                "summary": "The exponential growth of social media has profoundly transformed how\ninformation is created, disseminated, and absorbed, exceeding any precedent in\nthe digital age. Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant\nincrease in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes\nis notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings,\nwhich are not directly conveyed through the overt text and imagery. In light of\nthis, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest\ndue to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In\nresponse to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity\nof various LMMs (e.g., GPT-4V) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of\nsocial abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme\nbenchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes\nsuch as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing\nGOAT-Bench, we delve into the ability of LMMs to accurately assess hatefulness,\nmisogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content. Our extensive\nexperiments across a range of LMMs reveal that current models still exhibit a\ndeficiency in safety awareness, showing insensitivity to various forms of\nimplicit abuse. We posit that this shortfall represents a critical impediment\nto the realization of safe artificial intelligence.

As the important intermediation of\nfinancial products investment, these platforms distribute thousands of mutual\nfunds obtaining impressions under guaranteed delivery (GD) strategy required by\nfund companies. Driven by the profit from fund purchases of users, the platform\naims to maximize each transaction amount of customers by promoting mutual funds\nto these investors who will be interested in. Different from the conversions in\ntraditional advertising or e-commerce recommendations, the investment amount in\neach purchase varies greatly even for the same financial product, which\nprovides a significant challenge for the promotion recommendation of mutual\nfunds. In addition to predicting the click-through rate (CTR) or the conversion\nrate (CVR) as in traditional recommendations, it is essential for FinTech\nplatforms to estimate the customers' purchase amount for each delivered fund\nand achieve an effective allocation of impressions based on the predicted\nresults to optimize the total expected transaction value (ETV). In this paper,\nwe propose an ETV optimized customer allocation framework (EOCA) that aims to\nmaximize the total ETV of recommended funds, under the constraints of GD dealt\nwith fund companies. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first attempt to\nsolve the GD problem for financial product promotions based on customer\npurchase amount prediction.

                "summary": "Two-sided matching markets have been widely studied in the literature due to\ntheir rich applications. Since participants are usually uncertain about their\npreferences, online algorithms have recently been adopted to learn them through\niterative interactions. An existing work initiates the study of this problem in\na many-to-one setting with responsiveness. However, their results are far from\noptimal and lack guarantees of incentive compatibility. We first extend an\nexisting algorithm for the one-to-one setting to this more general setting and\nshow it achieves a near-optimal bound for player-optimal regret. Nevertheless,\ndue to the substantial requirement for collaboration, a single player's\ndeviation could lead to a huge increase in its own cumulative rewards and a\nlinear regret for others. In this paper, we aim to enhance the regret bound in\nmany-to-one markets while ensuring incentive compatibility. We first propose\nthe adaptively explore-then-deferred-acceptance (AETDA) algorithm for\nresponsiveness setting and derive an upper bound for player-optimal stable\nregret while demonstrating its guarantee of incentive compatibility. To the\nbest of our knowledge, it constitutes the first polynomial player-optimal\nguarantee in matching markets that offers such robust assurances without known\n$\\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is some preference gap among players and arms. We also\nconsider broader substitutable preferences, one of the most general conditions\nto ensure the existence of a stable matching and cover responsiveness. We\ndevise an online DA (ODA) algorithm and establish an upper bound for the\nplayer-pessimal stable regret for this setting.",

                "summary": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has emerged as a vital tool to evaluate\nagents' ability to understand human daily behaviors. Despite the recent success\nof large vision language models in many multi-modal tasks, complex situation\nreasoning over videos involving multiple human-object interaction events still\nremains challenging. In contrast, humans can easily tackle it by using a series\nof episode memories as anchors to quickly locate question-related key moments\nfor reasoning. To mimic this effective reasoning strategy, we propose the\nGlance-Focus model. One simple way is to apply an action detection model to\npredict a set of actions as key memories. However, these actions within a\nclosed set vocabulary are hard to generalize to various video domains. Instead\nof that, we train an Encoder-Decoder to generate a set of dynamic event\nmemories at the glancing stage. Apart from using supervised bipartite matching\nto obtain the event memories, we further design an unsupervised memory\ngeneration method to get rid of dependence on event annotations. Next, at the\nfocusing stage, these event memories act as a bridge to establish the\ncorrelation between the questions with high-level event concepts and low-level\nlengthy video content. Given the question, the model first focuses on the\ngenerated key event memory, then focuses on the most relevant moment for\nreasoning through our designed multi-level cross-attention mechanism. We\nconduct extensive experiments on four Multi-Event VideoQA benchmarks including\nSTAR, EgoTaskQA, AGQA, and NExT-QA. Our proposed model achieves\nstate-of-the-art results, surpassing current large models in various\nchallenging reasoning tasks.

                "summary": "This paper explores opportunities and challenges of task (goal)-oriented and\nsemantic communications for next-generation (NextG) communication networks\nthrough the integration of multi-task learning. This approach employs deep\nneural networks representing a dedicated encoder at the transmitter and\nmultiple task-specific decoders at the receiver, collectively trained to handle\ndiverse tasks including semantic information preservation, source input\nreconstruction, and integrated sensing and communications. To extend the\napplicability from point-to-point links to multi-receiver settings, we envision\nthe deployment of decoders at various receivers, where decentralized learning\naddresses the challenges of communication load and privacy concerns, leveraging\nfederated learning techniques that distribute model updates across\ndecentralized nodes. However, the efficacy of this approach is contingent on\nthe robustness of the employed deep learning models. We scrutinize potential\nvulnerabilities stemming from adversarial attacks during both training and\ntesting phases. These attacks aim to manipulate both the inputs at the encoder\nat the transmitter and the signals received over the air on the receiver side,\nhighlighting the importance of fortifying semantic communications against\npotential multi-domain exploits. Overall, the joint and robust design of\ntask-oriented communications, semantic communications, and integrated sensing\nand communications in a multi-task learning framework emerges as the key\nenabler for context-aware, resource-efficient, and secure communications\nultimately needed in NextG network systems.",

In\nthis paper, we consider the Zermelo navigation problem on optical Riemannian\nspace and, via Zermelo/Randers/spacetime triangle, explore the generation of\nnew spacetimes from pre-existing ones. Whether the Randers metric has\nreversible geodesics corresponds to the presence of time-reversal symmetry in\nthe generated spacetime. In cases where the Randers metric has reversible\ngeodesics, we utilize a radial vector field to generate new static spacetimes\nfrom existing ones. For example, we can generate Schwarzschild, Rindler, de\nSitter, and Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes from flat spacetime. In fact,\nthe Zermelo navigation method allows for the derivation of a variety of static\nspacetimes from flat spacetime. For multi-parameter spacetimes, they can be\ngenerated through various navigation paths. However, for some spacetimes, not\nall navigation paths may exist. In the second scenario, when the Randers metric\ndoes not have reversible geodesics, we employ a rotational vector field to\ntransform non-flat static metrics into slowly rotating spacetimes.\nAlternatively, using a mixed vector field, we generate slowly rotating\nspacetimes starting from flat spacetime. We provide examples of generating Kerr\nspacetimes and Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes.",

                "summary": "Coherent small-amplitude unsteadiness of the shock wave and the separation\nregion over a canonical double cone flow, termed in literature as\noscillation-type unsteadiness, is experimentally studied at Mach 6. The double\ncone model is defined by three non-dimensional geometric parameters: fore- and\naft-cone angles ($\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$), and ratio of the conical slant\nlengths ($\\Lambda$). Previous studies of oscillations have been qualitative in\nnature, and mostly restricted to a special case of the cone model with fixed\n$\\theta_1 = 0^\\circ$ and $\\theta_2 = 90^\\circ$ (referred to as the\nspike-cylinder model), where $\\Lambda$ becomes the sole governing parameter. In\nthe present effort we investigate the self-sustained flow oscillations in the\n$\\theta_1$-$\\Lambda$ parameter space for fixed $\\theta_2 = 90^\\circ$ using\ntime-resolved schlieren visualization. The experiments reveal two distinct\nsub-types of oscillations, characterized by the motion (or lack thereof) of the\nseparation point on the fore-cone surface. The global time scale associated\nwith flow oscillation is extracted using spectral proper orthogonal\ndecomposition. The non-dimensional frequency (Strouhal number) of oscillation\nis seen to exhibit distinct scaling for the two oscillation sub-types. The\nrelationship observed between the local flow properties, instability of the\nshear layer, and geometric constraints on the flow suggests that an\naeroacoustic feedback mechanism sustains the oscillations. Based on this\ninsight, a simple model with no empiricism is developed for the Strouhal\nnumber. The model predictions are found to match well with experimental\nmeasurements. The model provides helpful physical insight into the nature of\nthe self-sustained flow oscillations over a double cone at high-speeds.",

These\nthree relations consist of the standard and two redshift-evolutionary\n$L_X$-$L_{UV}$ relations which are constructed respectively by considering a\nredshift dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars and using the\nstatistical tool called copula. By employing the PAge approximation for a\ncosmological-model-independent description of the cosmic background evolution\nand dividing the quasar data into the low-redshift and high-redshift parts, we\nfind that the constraints on the PAge parameters from the low-redshift and\nhigh-redshift data, which are obtained with the redshift-evolutionary\nrelations, are consistent with each other, while they are not when the standard\nrelation is considered. If the data are used to constrain the coefficients of\nthe relations and the PAge parameters simultaneously, then the observations\nsupport the redshift-evolutionary relations at more than $3\\sigma$. The Akaike\nand Bayes information criteria indicate that there is strong evidence against\nthe standard relation and mild evidence against the redshift-evolutionary\nrelation constructed by considering a redshift dependent correction to the\nluminosities of quasars. This suggests that the redshift-evolutionary\n$L_X$-$L_{UV}$ relation of quasars constructed from copula is favored by the\nobservations.",

Employing an appropriate approximation, we derive exact solutions\nthat illuminate the behaviors of number density, local temperature, and heat in\nthe proximity of a black hole. We demonstrate that a carefully regulated heat\ninflow can maintain finite local temperatures at the black hole event horizon,\neven without considering the back-reaction of matter.

With the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), data anonymization\naugments the likelihood of covering up necessary sensitive information;\npreventing data leakage and information loss. OpenWiFi networks are vulnerable\nto any adversary who is trying to gain access or knowledge on traffic\nregardless of the knowledge possessed by data owners. The odds for discovery of\nactual traffic information is addressed by applied conditional tabular\ngenerative adversarial network (CTGAN). CTGAN yields synthetic data; which\ndisguises as actual data but fostering hidden acute information of actual data.\nIn this paper, the similarity assessment of synthetic with actual data is\nshowcased in terms of clustering algorithms followed by a comparison of\nperformance for unsupervised cluster validation metrics. A well-known\nalgorithm, K-means outperforms other algorithms in terms of similarity\nassessment of synthetic data over real data while achieving nearest scores\n0.634, 23714.57, and 0.598 as Silhouette, Calinski and Harabasz and Davies\nBouldin metric respectively. On exploiting a comparative analysis in validation\nscores among several algorithms, K-means forms the epitome of unsupervised\nclustering algorithms ensuring explicit usage of synthetic data at the same\ntime a replacement for real data. Hence, the experimental results aim to show\nthe viability of using CTGAN-generated synthetic data in lieu of publishing\nanonymized data to be utilized in various applications.",

                "summary": "Quantization is of significance for compressing the over-parameterized deep\nneural models and deploying them on resource-limited devices. Fixed-precision\nquantization suffers from performance drop due to the limited numerical\nrepresentation ability. Conversely, mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is\nadvocated to compress the model effectively by allocating heterogeneous\nbit-width for layers. MPQ is typically organized into a searching-retraining\ntwo-stage process. In this paper, we devise a one-shot training-searching\nparadigm for mixed-precision model compression. Specifically, in the first\nstage, all potential bit-width configurations are coupled and thus optimized\nsimultaneously within a set of shared weights. However, our observations reveal\na previously unseen and severe bit-width interference phenomenon among highly\ncoupled weights during optimization, leading to considerable performance\ndegradation under a high compression ratio. To tackle this problem, we first\ndesign a bit-width scheduler to dynamically freeze the most turbulent bit-width\nof layers during training, to ensure the rest bit-widths converged properly.\nThen, taking inspiration from information theory, we present an information\ndistortion mitigation technique to align the behavior of the bad-performing\nbit-widths to the well-performing ones. In the second stage, an inference-only\ngreedy search scheme is devised to evaluate the goodness of configurations\nwithout introducing any additional training costs. Extensive experiments on\nthree representative models and three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method.

                "summary": "Autonomous driving has attracted significant attention from both academia and\nindustries, which is expected to offer a safer and more efficient driving\nsystem. However, current autonomous driving systems are mostly based on a\nsingle vehicle, which has significant limitations which still poses threats to\ndriving safety. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles\n(CAVs) shows a promising solution to overcoming these limitations. In this\narticle, we first identify the challenges of collaborative perception, such as\ndata sharing asynchrony, data volume, and pose errors. Then, we discuss the\npossible solutions to address these challenges with various technologies, where\nthe research opportunities are also elaborated. Furthermore, we propose a\nscheme to deal with communication efficiency and latency problems, which is a\nchannel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the\ncommunication graph and minimize latency, thereby improving perception\nperformance while increasing communication efficiency. Finally, we conduct\nexperiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.",

However, they encounter tracking drift and mapping\nerrors in real-world scenarios with dynamic interferences. To address these\nissues, we introduce DDN-SLAM, the first real-time dense dynamic neural\nimplicit SLAM system integrating semantic features. To address dynamic tracking\ninterferences, we propose a feature point segmentation method that combines\nsemantic features with a mixed Gaussian distribution model. To avoid incorrect\nbackground removal, we propose a mapping strategy based on sparse point cloud\nsampling and background restoration. We propose a dynamic semantic loss to\neliminate dynamic occlusions. Experimental results demonstrate that DDN-SLAM is\ncapable of robustly tracking and producing high-quality reconstructions in\ndynamic environments, while appropriately preserving potential dynamic objects.\nCompared to existing neural implicit SLAM systems, the tracking results on\ndynamic datasets indicate an average 90% improvement in Average Trajectory\nError (ATE) accuracy.",

A limitation on its solution by numerics is posed by the sign\nproblem, which constrains the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo techniques\nat sufficiently low temperatures and large lattice sizes, where a potential\nsignature of polarized superfluidity would be unambiguous. By using a recently\nexplored argument that the sign problem may be used instead to infer quantum\ncritical behavior, we explore the regime where partial polarization occurs in\nthe phase diagram, further showing that the average sign $\\langle {\\cal\nS}\\rangle$ of quantum Monte Carlo weights tracks the criticality between\nbalanced (or fully polarized) and polarized phases. Using the attractive\nHubbard model with an unbalanced population, our investigation expands the\nscope of problems in which $\\langle {\\cal S}\\rangle$ can be used for monitoring\ncritical behavior, providing compelling albeit indirect evidence for the\nrobustness of an FFLO phase in 2D.",

However, INR models are typically\noverparameterized; consequently, these models are prone to overfitting during\nlearning, resulting in suboptimal results, even noisy ones. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a general recipe for regularizing INR models in image\ndenoising. In detail, we propose to iteratively substitute the supervision\nsignal with the mean value derived from both the prediction and supervision\nsignal during the learning process. We theoretically prove that such a simple\niterative substitute can gradually enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the\nsupervision signal, thereby benefiting INR models during the learning process.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that INR models can be effectively\nregularized by the proposed approach, relieving overfitting and boosting image\ndenoising performance.",

                "summary": "Despite the recent progress in deep neural networks (DNNs), it remains\nchallenging to explain the predictions made by DNNs. Existing explanation\nmethods for DNNs mainly focus on post-hoc explanations where another\nexplanatory model is employed to provide explanations. The fact that post-hoc\nmethods can fail to reveal the actual original reasoning process of DNNs raises\nthe need to build DNNs with built-in interpretability. Motivated by this, many\nself-explaining neural networks have been proposed to generate not only\naccurate predictions but also clear and intuitive insights into why a\nparticular decision was made. However, existing self-explaining networks are\nlimited in providing distribution-free uncertainty quantification for the two\nsimultaneously generated prediction outcomes (i.e., a sample's final prediction\nand its corresponding explanations for interpreting that prediction).\nImportantly, they also fail to establish a connection between the confidence\nvalues assigned to the generated explanations in the interpretation layer and\nthose allocated to the final predictions in the ultimate prediction layer. To\ntackle the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we design a novel\nuncertainty modeling framework for self-explaining networks, which not only\ndemonstrates strong distribution-free uncertainty modeling performance for the\ngenerated explanations in the interpretation layer but also excels in producing\nefficient and effective prediction sets for the final predictions based on the\ninformative high-level basis explanations. We perform the theoretical analysis\nfor the proposed framework. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the\neffectiveness of the proposed uncertainty framework.",

In this work, we unveil one of the key ingredients behind these\nmethods: meticulously devised feature extraction operations with explicit\ncross-resolution aggregation. We present Cross-Resolution Transformer that\nefficiently performs cross-resolution aggregation with local attention\nmechanisms. With the help of our recursive designs, the proposed operation can\ncapture more scales of features than common aggregation operations, which is\nbeneficial for capturing fine geometric characteristics. While prior\nmethodologies have ventured into various manifestations of inter-level\ncross-resolution aggregation, the effectiveness of intra-level one and their\ncombination has not been analyzed. With unified designs, Cross-Resolution\nTransformer can perform intra- or inter-level cross-resolution aggregation by\nswitching inputs. We integrate two forms of Cross-Resolution Transformers into\none up-sampling block for point generation, and following the coarse-to-fine\nmanner, we construct CRA-PCN to incrementally predict complete shapes with\nstacked up-sampling blocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on several widely used\nbenchmarks.

Using multi-modal data, whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical\ninformation, can improve the performance of deep learning models in the\ndiagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. However, clinical information is\nnot easy to collect in clinical practice due to privacy concerns, limited\nresources, lack of interoperability, etc. Although patient selection can ensure\nthe training set to have multi-modal data for model development, missing\nmodality of clinical information can appear during test. This normally leads to\nperformance degradation, which limits the use of multi-modal models in the\nclinic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional distillation\nframework consisting of a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch. The\nsingle-modal branch acquires the complete multi-modal knowledge from the\nmulti-modal branch, while the multi-modal learns the robust features of WSI\nfrom the single-modal. We conduct experiments on a public dataset of Lymph Node\nMetastasis in Early Breast Cancer to validate the method. Our approach not only\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 0.861 on the test set\nwithout missing data, but also yields an AUC of 0.842 when the rate of missing\nmodality is 80\\%. This shows the effectiveness of the approach in dealing with\nmulti-modal data and missing modality. Such a model has the potential to\nimprove treatment decision-making for early breast cancer patients who have\naxillary lymph node metastatic status.",

                "summary": "The quantum SearchRank algorithm is a promising tool for a future quantum\nsearch engine based on PageRank quantization. However, this algorithm loses its\nfunctionality when the $N/M$ ratio between the network size $N$ and the number\nof marked nodes $M$ is sufficiently large. We propose a modification of the\nalgorithm, replacing the underlying Szegedy quantum walk with a semiclassical\nwalk. To maintain the same time complexity as the quantum SearchRank algorithm\nwe propose a simplification of the algorithm. This new algorithm is called\nRandomized SearchRank, since it corresponds to a quantum walk over a randomized\nmixed state. The performance of the SearchRank algorithms is first analyzed on\nan example network, and then statistically on a set of different networks of\nincreasing size and different number of marked nodes. On the one hand, to test\nthe search ability of the algorithms, it is computed how the probability of\nmeasuring the marked nodes decreases with $N/M$ for the quantum SearchRank, but\nremarkably it remains at a high value around $0.9$ for our semiclassical\nalgorithms, solving the quantum SearchRank problem. The time complexity of the\nalgorithms is also analyzed, obtaining a quadratic speedup with respect to the\nclassical ones. On the other hand, the ranking functionality of the algorithms\nhas been investigated, obtaining a good agreement with the classical PageRank\ndistribution. Finally, the dependence of these algorithms on the intrinsic\nPageRank damping parameter has been clarified. Our results suggest that this\nparameter should be below a threshold so that the execution time does not\nincrease drastically.",

However, the high entrance dose of VHEE beams can damage\nthe surface skin of patients and hinder its widespread application. To address\nthis challenge, a novel method utilizing only two dipole magnets is presented\nin this article. By adjusting the magnet strengths, the electron beams can be\nguided along different angular directions towards a specific position as deep\nas 20 cm inside a water phantom, creating a maximum dose over the target region\nand significantly reducing the entrance dose Supported by Monte Carlo\nsimulations, such a beam delivery approach contains two major advantages over\nprevious methods: first, it is insensitive to beam energy spread, releasing the\nconstraints on accelerator performance, and second, the dose peak position can\nbe accurately controlled in both lateral and longitudinal directions. In\naddition, we also show that a flattop dose peak can be generated by the\nweighted sum of VHEE beams focusing at different positions. These results\ndemonstrate that VHEE beams can be compactly delivered into a deep-seated tumor\nregion in a controllable manner, thus advancing the development of the VHEE\nradiotherapy towards the practical clinical applications in the near future.",

One bottleneck faced by\nexisting late fusion methods is that they are usually aligned to the average\nkernel function, which makes the clustering performance highly dependent on the\nquality of datasets. Another problem is that they require subsequent k-means\nclustering after obtaining the consensus partition matrix to get the final\ndiscrete labels, and the resulting separation of the label learning and cluster\nstructure optimization processes limits the integrity of these models. To\naddress the above issues, we propose an integrated framework named One-Step\nLate Fusion Multi-view Clustering with Compressed Subspace (OS-LFMVC-CS).\nSpecifically, we use the consensus subspace to align the partition matrix while\noptimizing the partition fusion, and utilize the fused partition matrix to\nguide the learning of discrete labels. A six-step iterative optimization\napproach with verified convergence is proposed. Sufficient experiments on\nmultiple datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed\nmethod.",

We analyze here multiscale gas\ndynamics in an HMSF filamentary cloud, G034.43+00.24 (G34), using APEX\nobservations of the C18O (2-1), HCO+/H13CO+ (3-2), and HCN/H13CN (3-2) lines.\nWe find large-scale, filament-aligned velocity gradients from C18O emission,\nwhich drive filamentary gas inflows onto dense clumps in the middle ridge of\nG34. The nature of these inflows is gravity driven. We also find clump-scale\ngas infall in the middle ridge of the MM2, MM4, and MM5 clumps from other\nlines. Their gas infall rates could depend on large-scale filamentary gas\ninflows since the infall/inflow rates on these two scales are comparable. We\nconfirm that the multiscale, dynamical HMSF scenario is at work in G34. It\ncould be driven by gravity up to the filament scale, beyond which turbulence\noriginating from several sources, including gravity, could be in effect in G34.",

                "summary": "Ultra-low-noise laser sources are crucial for a variety of applications,\nincluding microwave synthesizers, optical gyroscopes, and the manipulation of\nquantum systems. Silicon photonics has emerged as a promising solution for\nhigh-coherence applications due to its ability to reduce system size, weight,\npower consumption, and cost (SWaP-C). Semiconductor lasers based on\nself-injection locking (SIL) have reached fiber laser coherence, but typically\nrequire a high-Q external cavity to suppress coherence collapse through\nfrequency-selective feedback. Lasers based on external-cavity locking (ECL) are\na low-cost and turnkey operation option, but their coherence is generally\ninferior to SIL lasers. In this work, we demonstrate quantum-dot (QD) lasers\ngrown directly on Si that achieve SIL laser coherence under turnkey ECL. The\nhigh-performance QD laser offers a scalable and low-cost heteroepitaxial\nintegration platform. Moreover, the QD laser's chaos-free nature enables a 16\nHz Lorentzian linewidth under ECL using a low-Q external cavity, and improves\nthe frequency noise by an additional order of magnitude compared to\nconventional quantum-well lasers.",

                "summary": "Evolutionary Multitasking (EMT) paradigm, an emerging research topic in\nevolutionary computation, has been successfully applied in solving\nhigh-dimensional feature selection (FS) problems recently. However, existing\nEMT-based FS methods suffer from several limitations, such as a single mode of\nmultitask generation, conducting the same generic evolutionary search for all\ntasks, relying on implicit transfer mechanisms through sole solution encodings,\nand employing single-objective transformation, which result in inadequate\nknowledge acquisition, exploitation, and transfer. To this end, this paper\ndevelops a novel EMT framework for multiobjective high-dimensional feature\nselection problems, namely MO-FSEMT. In particular, multiple auxiliary tasks\nare constructed by distinct formulation methods to provide diverse search\nspaces and information representations and then simultaneously addressed with\nthe original task through a multi-slover-based multitask optimization scheme.\nEach task has an independent population with task-specific representations and\nis solved using separate evolutionary solvers with different biases and search\npreferences. A task-specific knowledge transfer mechanism is designed to\nleverage the advantage information of each task, enabling the discovery and\neffective transmission of high-quality solutions during the search process.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our MO-FSEMT framework can\nachieve overall superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art FS\nmethods on 26 datasets. Moreover, the ablation studies verify the contributions\nof different components of the proposed MO-FSEMT.",

                "summary": "We consider multi-user semantic communications over broadcast channels. While\nmost existing works consider that each receiver requires either the same or\nindependent semantic information, this paper explores the scenario where the\nsemantic information desired by different receivers is different but\ncorrelated. In particular, we investigate semantic communications over Gaussian\nbroadcast channels where the transmitter has a common observable source but the\nreceivers wish to recover hierarchical semantic information in adaptation to\ntheir channel conditions. Inspired by the capacity achieving property of\nsuperposition codes, we propose a deep learning based superposition coded\nmodulation (DeepSCM) scheme. Specifically, the hierarchical semantic\ninformation is first extracted and encoded into basic and enhanced feature\nvectors. A linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) decorrelator is then\ndeveloped to obtain a refinement from the enhanced features that is\nuncorrelated with the basic features. Finally, the basic features and their\nrefinement are superposed for broadcasting after probabilistic modulation.\nExperiments are conducted for two-receiver image semantic broadcasting with\ncoarse and fine classification as hierarchical semantic tasks. DeepSCM\noutperforms the benchmarking coded-modulation scheme without a superposition\nstructure, especially with large channel disparity and high order modulation.\nIt also approaches the performance upperbound as if there were only one\nreceiver.",

                "summary": "This paper proposes a Heaviside composite optimization approach and presents\na progressive (mixed) integer programming (PIP) method for solving multi-class\nclassification and multi-action treatment problems with constraints. A\nHeaviside composite function is a composite of a Heaviside function (i.e., the\nindicator function of either the open $( \\, 0,\\infty )$ or closed $[ \\,\n0,\\infty \\, )$ interval) with a possibly nondifferentiable function.\nModeling-wise, we show how Heaviside composite optimization provides a unified\nformulation for learning the optimal multi-class classification and\nmulti-action treatment rules, subject to rule-dependent constraints stipulating\na variety of domain restrictions. A Heaviside composite function has an\nequivalent discrete formulation, and the resulting optimization problem can in\nprinciple be solved by integer programming (IP) methods. Nevertheless, for\nconstrained learning problems with large data sets, a straightforward\napplication of off-the-shelf IP solvers is usually ineffective in achieving\nglobal optimality. To alleviate such a computational burden, our major\ncontribution is the proposal of the PIP method by leveraging the effectiveness\nof state-of-the-art IP solvers for problems of modest sizes. We provide the\ntheoretical advantage of the PIP method with the connection to continuous\noptimization and show that the computed solution is locally optimal for a broad\nclass of Heaviside composite optimization problems. The numerical performance\nof the PIP method is demonstrated by extensive computational experimentation.",

                "summary": "Mergers of binary compact objects, accompanied with electromagnetic (EM)\ncounterparts, offer excellent opportunities to explore varied cosmological\nmodels, since gravitational waves (GWs) and EM counterparts always carry the\ninformation of luminosity distance and redshift, respectively. $f(T)$ gravity,\nwhich alters the background evolution and provides a friction term in the\npropagation of GWs, can be tested by comparing the modified GW luminosity\ndistance with the EM luminosity distance. Considering the third-generation\ngravitational-wave detectors, Einstein Telescope and two cosmic explorers, we\nsimulate a series of GW events of binary neutron stars and\nneutron-star-black-hole binaries with EM counterparts. These simulations can be\nused to constrain $f(T)$ gravity [especially the power-law model\n$f(T)=T+\\alpha(-T)^\\beta$ in this work] and other cosmological parameters, such\nas $\\beta$ and the Hubble constant. In addition, combining simulations with\ncurrent observations of type Ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations, we\nobtain tighter limitations for $f(T)$ gravity. We find that the estimated\nprecision significantly improved when all three datasets are combined ($\\Delta\n\\beta \\sim 0.03$), compared to analyzing the current observations alone\n($\\Delta \\beta \\sim 0.3$). Simultaneously, the uncertainty of the Hubble\nconstant can be reduced to approximately $1\\%$.",

                "summary": "Recently, many algorithms have employed image-adaptive lookup tables (LUTs)\nto achieve real-time image enhancement. Nonetheless, a prevailing trend among\nexisting methods has been the employment of linear combinations of basic LUTs\nto formulate image-adaptive LUTs, which limits the generalization ability of\nthese methods. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework named\nAttentionLut for real-time image enhancement, which utilizes the attention\nmechanism to generate image-adaptive LUTs. Our proposed framework consists of\nthree lightweight modules. We begin by employing the global image context\nfeature module to extract image-adaptive features. Subsequently, the attention\nfusion module integrates the image feature with the priori attention feature\nobtained during training to generate image-adaptive canonical polyadic tensors.\nFinally, the canonical polyadic reconstruction module is deployed to\nreconstruct image-adaptive residual 3DLUT, which is subsequently utilized for\nenhancing input images. Experiments on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves better enhancement performance\nquantitatively and qualitatively than the state-of-the-art methods.",

                "summary": "In the domain of large-scale software development, the demands for dynamic\nand multifaceted static code analysis exceed the capabilities of traditional\ntools. To bridge this gap, we present CodeFuse-Query, a system that redefines\nstatic code analysis through the fusion of Domain Optimized System Design and\nLogic Oriented Computation Design.\n  CodeFuse-Query reimagines code analysis as a data computation task, support\nscanning over 10 billion lines of code daily and more than 300 different tasks.\nIt optimizes resource utilization, prioritizes data reusability, applies\nincremental code extraction, and introduces tasks types specially for Code\nChange, underscoring its domain-optimized design. The system's logic-oriented\nfacet employs Datalog, utilizing a unique two-tiered schema, COREF, to convert\nsource code into data facts. Through Godel, a distinctive language,\nCodeFuse-Query enables formulation of complex tasks as logical expressions,\nharnessing Datalog's declarative prowess.\n  This paper provides empirical evidence of CodeFuse-Query's transformative\napproach, demonstrating its robustness, scalability, and efficiency. We also\nhighlight its real-world impact and diverse applications, emphasizing its\npotential to reshape the landscape of static code analysis in the context of\nlarge-scale software development.Furthermore, in the spirit of collaboration\nand advancing the field, our project is open-sourced and the repository is\navailable for public access",

Here, we define\nhallucinations in ASR as transcriptions generated by a model that are\nsemantically unrelated to the source utterance, yet still fluent and coherent.\nThe similarity of hallucinations to probable natural language outputs of the\nmodel creates a danger of deception and impacts the credibility of the system.\nWe show that commonly used metrics, such as word error rates, cannot\ndifferentiate between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models. To address\nthis, we propose a perturbation-based method for assessing the susceptibility\nof an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to hallucination at test time,\nwhich does not require access to the training dataset. We demonstrate that this\nmethod helps to distinguish between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models\nthat have similar baseline word error rates. We further explore the\nrelationship between the types of ASR errors and the types of dataset noise to\ndetermine what types of noise are most likely to create hallucinatory outputs.\nWe devise a framework for identifying hallucinations by analysing their\nsemantic connection with the ground truth and their fluency. Finally, we\ndiscover how to induce hallucinations with a random noise injection to the\nutterance.",

                "summary": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) visual geo-localization aims to match images of\nthe same geographic target captured from different views, i.e., the UAV view\nand the satellite view. It is very challenging due to the large appearance\ndifferences in UAV-satellite image pairs. Previous works map images captured by\nUAVs and satellites to a shared feature space and employ a classification\nframework to learn location-dependent features while neglecting the overall\ndistribution shift between the UAV view and the satellite view. In this paper,\nwe address these limitations by introducing distribution alignment of the two\nviews to shorten their distance in a common space. Specifically, we propose an\nend-to-end network, called PVDA (Progressive View Distribution Alignment).\nDuring training, feature encoder, location classifier, and view discriminator\nare jointly optimized by a novel progressive adversarial learning strategy.\nCompetition between feature encoder and view discriminator prompts both of them\nto be stronger. It turns out that the adversarial learning is progressively\nemphasized until UAV-view images are indistinguishable from satellite-view\nimages. As a result, the proposed PVDA becomes powerful in learning\nlocation-dependent yet view-invariant features with good scalability towards\nunseen images of new locations. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the\nproposed PVDA requires less inference time but has achieved superior\nperformance on the University-1652 dataset.",

In general, the key to\nachieving accurate UAV-satellite image matching lies in extracting visual\nfeatures that are robust against viewpoint changes, scale variations, and\nrotations. Current works have shown that part matching is crucial for UAV\nvisual geo-localization since part-level representations can capture image\ndetails and help to understand the semantic information of scenes. However, the\nimportance of preserving semantic characteristics in part-level representations\nis not well discussed. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based adaptive\nsemantic aggregation method that regards parts as the most representative\nsemantics in an image. Correlations of image patches to different parts are\nlearned in terms of the transformer's feature map. Then our method decomposes\npart-level features into an adaptive sum of all patch features. By doing this,\nthe learned parts are encouraged to focus on patches with typical semantics.\nExtensive experiments on the University-1652 dataset have shown the superiority\nof our method over the current works.",

                "summary": "The blooming of social media and face recognition (FR) systems has increased\npeople's concern about privacy and security. A new type of adversarial privacy\ncloak (class-universal) can be applied to all the images of regular users, to\nprevent malicious FR systems from acquiring their identity information. In this\nwork, we discover the optimization dilemma in the existing methods -- the local\noptima problem in large-batch optimization and the gradient information\nelimination problem in small-batch optimization. To solve these problems, we\npropose Gradient Accumulation (GA) to aggregate multiple small-batch gradients\ninto a one-step iterative gradient to enhance the gradient stability and reduce\nthe usage of quantization operations. Experiments show that our proposed method\nachieves high performance on the Privacy-Commons dataset against black-box face\nrecognition models.",

                "summary": "Despite the recent remarkable achievement in gaze estimation, efficient and\naccurate personalization of gaze estimation without labels is a practical\nproblem but rarely touched on in the literature. To achieve efficient\npersonalization, we take inspiration from the recent advances in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) by updating a negligible number of parameters,\n\"prompts\", at the test time. Specifically, the prompt is additionally attached\nwithout perturbing original network and can contain less than 1% of a\nResNet-18's parameters. Our experiments show high efficiency of the prompt\ntuning approach. The proposed one can be 10 times faster in terms of adaptation\nspeed than the methods compared. However, it is non-trivial to update the\nprompt for personalized gaze estimation without labels. At the test time, it is\nessential to ensure that the minimizing of particular unsupervised loss leads\nto the goals of minimizing gaze estimation error. To address this difficulty,\nwe propose to meta-learn the prompt to ensure that its updates align with the\ngoal. Our experiments show that the meta-learned prompt can be effectively\nadapted even with a simple symmetry loss. In addition, we experiment on four\ncross-dataset validations to show the remarkable advantages of the proposed\nmethod. Code is available at https://github.com/hmarkamcan/TPGaze.",

                "summary": "Spatio-temporal video grounding (or STVG) task aims at locating a\nspatio-temporal tube for a specific instance given a text query. Despite\nadvancements, current methods easily suffer the distractors or heavy object\nappearance variations in videos due to insufficient object information from the\ntext, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we propose a novel framework,\ncontext-guided STVG (CG-STVG), which mines discriminative instance context for\nobject in videos and applies it as a supplementary guidance for target\nlocalization. The key of CG-STVG lies in two specially designed modules,\nincluding instance context generation (ICG), which focuses on discovering\nvisual context information (in both appearance and motion) of the instance, and\ninstance context refinement (ICR), which aims to improve the instance context\nfrom ICG by eliminating irrelevant or even harmful information from the\ncontext. During grounding, ICG, together with ICR, are deployed at each\ndecoding stage of a Transformer architecture for instance context learning.\nParticularly, instance context learned from one decoding stage is fed to the\nnext stage, and leveraged as a guidance containing rich and discriminative\nobject feature to enhance the target-awareness in decoding feature, which\nconversely benefits generating better new instance context for improving\nlocalization finally. Compared to existing methods, CG-STVG enjoys object\ninformation in text query and guidance from mined instance visual context for\nmore accurate target localization. In our experiments on three benchmarks,\nincluding HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG, CG-STVG sets new state-of-the-arts in\nm_tIoU and m_vIoU on all of them, showing its efficacy.

                "summary": "With the increase in the number of electric vehicles (EV), there is a need\nfor the development of the EV charging infrastructure (EVCI) to facilitate fast\ncharging, thereby mitigating the EV congestion at charging stations. The role\nof the public charging station depot is to charge the vehicle, prioritizing the\nachievement of the desired state of charge (SoC) value for the EV battery or\ncharging till the departure of the EV, whichever occurs first. The integration\nof cyber and physical components within EVCI defines it as a cyber physical\npower system (CPPS), increasing its vulnerability to diverse cyber attacks.\nWhen an EV interfaces with the EVCI, mutual exchange of data takes place via\nvarious communication protocols like the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP), and\nIEC 61850. Unauthorized access to this data by intruders leads to cyber\nattacks, potentially resulting in consequences like energy theft, and revenue\nloss. These scenarios may cause the EVCI to incur higher charges than the\nactual energy consumed or the EV owners to remit payments that do not\ncorrespond adequately to the amount of energy they have consumed. This article\nproposes an EVCI architecture connected to the utility grid and uses the EVCI\ndata to identify the anomalies or outliers present in the EV transmitted data,\nparticularly focusing on SoC irregularities.",

                "summary": "When it comes to long-wavelength gravitational waves (GWs), diffraction\neffect becomes significant when these waves are lensed by celestial bodies.\nTypically, the traditional diffraction integral formula neglects large-angle\ndiffraction, which is often adequate for most of cases. Nonetheless, there are\nspecific scenarios, such as when a GW source is lensed by a supermassive black\nhole in a binary system, where the lens and source are in close proximity,\nwhere large-angle diffraction can play a crucial role. In our prior research,\nwe have introduced an exact, general diffraction integral formula that accounts\nfor large-angle diffraction as well. This paper explores the disparities\nbetween this exact diffraction formula and the traditional, approximate one\nunder various special conditions. Our findings indicate that, under specific\nparameters, such as a lens-source distance of $D_{\\rm LS}=0.1$\\,AU and a lens\nmass of $M_{\\rm L}=4\\times10^{6}M_\\odot$, the amplification factor for the\nexact diffraction formula is notably smaller than that of the approximate\nformula, differing by a factor of approximately $r_F\\simeq0.806$. This\ndifference is substantial enough to be detectable. Furthermore, our study\nreveals that the proportionality factor $r_F$ gradually increases from 0.5 to 1\nas $D_{\\rm LS}$ increases, and decreases as $M_{\\rm L}$ increases. Significant\ndifferences between the exact and approximate formulas are observable when\n$D_{\\rm LS}\\lesssim0.2$ AU (assuming $M_{\\rm L}=4\\times10^{6}M_\\odot$) or when\n$M_{\\rm L}\\gtrsim2\\times10^6M_\\odot$ (assuming $D_{\\rm LS}=0.1$ AU). These\nfindings suggest that there is potential to validate our general diffraction\nformula through future GW detections.",

For spanning trees $T_1, T_2, ..., T_m$, if every two\nof them are pairwisely edge-disjoint, they are called completely\nedge-independent spanning trees (CEISTs for short). CEISTs can facilitate many\nnetwork functionalities, and constructing CEISTs as maximally allowed as\npossible in a given network is a worthy undertaking. In this paper, we\nestablish the maximal number of CEISTs in the locally twisted cube network, and\npropose an algorithm to construct $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$ CEISTs in\n$LTQ_n$, the $n$-dimensional locally twisted cube.

Use of AI-based in-home medical care systems is\ngaining momentum due to this. Human fall detection is one of the most important\ntasks of medical care system for the aged people. Human fall is a common\nproblem among elderly people. Detection of a fall and providing medical help as\nearly as possible is very important to reduce any further complexity. The\nchances of death and other medical complications can be reduced by detecting\nand providing medical help as early as possible after the fall. There are many\nstate-of-the-art fall detection techniques available these days, but the\nmajority of them need very high computing power. In this paper, we proposed a\nlightweight and fast human fall detection system using pose estimation. We used\n`Movenet' for human joins key-points extraction. Our proposed method can work\nin real-time on any low-computing device with any basic camera. All computation\ncan be processed locally, so there is no problem of privacy of the subject. We\nused two datasets `GMDCSA' and `URFD' for the experiment. We got the\nsensitivity value of 0.9375 and 0.9167 for the dataset `GMDCSA' and `URFD'\nrespectively.

Unlike the time-consuming\nparameter training process of neural networks, Bayes classifiers constructed on\nBayesian networks can make decisions based solely on statistical data from\nsamples. In this paper, we focus on constructing quantum Bayes classifiers\n(QBCs). We design both a naive QBC and three semi-naive QBCs (SN-QBCs). These\nQBCs are then applied to image classification tasks. To reduce computational\ncomplexity, we employ a local feature sampling method to extract a limited\nnumber of feature attributes from an image. These attributes serve as nodes of\nthe Bayesian networks to generate the QBCs. We simulate these QBCs on the\nMindQuantum platform and evaluate their performance on the MNIST and\nFashion-MNIST datasets. Our results demonstrate that these QBCs achieve good\nclassification accuracies even with a limited number of attributes. The\nclassification accuracies of QBCs on the MNIST dataset surpass those of\nclassical Bayesian networks and quantum neural networks that utilize all\navailable feature attributes.",

                "summary": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a new computing paradigm that enables cloud\ncomputing and information technology (IT) services to be delivered at the\nnetwork's edge. By shifting the load of cloud computing to individual local\nservers, MEC helps meet the requirements of ultralow latency, localized data\nprocessing, and extends the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) for\nend-users. However, the crosscutting nature of MEC and the multidisciplinary\ncomponents necessary for its deployment have presented additional security and\nprivacy concerns. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms can cope\nwith excessively unpredictable and complex data, which offers a distinct\nadvantage in dealing with sophisticated and developing adversaries in the\nsecurity industry. Hence, in this paper we comprehensively provide a survey of\nsecurity and privacy in MEC from the perspective of AI. On the one hand, we use\nEuropean Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) MEC reference\narchitecture as our based framework while merging the Software Defined Network\n(SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to better illustrate a\nserviceable platform of MEC. On the other hand, we focus on new security and\nprivacy issues, as well as potential solutions from the viewpoints of AI.\nFinally, we comprehensively discuss the opportunities and challenges associated\nwith applying AI to MEC security and privacy as possible future research\ndirections.",

We\nconsider a hybrid system where a magnon mode is directly coupled to a\nnonresonant superconducting qubit via the exchange interaction. The magnon and\nqubit are under the driving and probing fields with the same frequency,\nrespectively. We find that the single-magnon probability $P_1$ can be maximized\nwhen the product of the magnon-driving field detuning and the qubit-probing\nfield detuning is equivalent to the square of the magnon-qubit coupling\nstrength, $\\Delta_q\\Delta_m=J^2$. Then, the double-magnon probability $P_2$ can\nbe minimized by tuning the ratio of the probing intensity to the driving\nintensity and the relative phase between the two fields. Under these optimized\nconditions with accessible strong driving intensity and low decay rate, strong\nmagnon blockade gives rise to a stable single-magnon state with a high quality.\nIt features a large brightness (the single-magnon probability) $P_1\\approx0.40$\nand a high purity (the equal-time second-order correlation function)\n$g^{(2)}(0)\\sim10^{-5}$.

This paper aims to enhance the\ndata efficiency by introducing multiple-to-multiple local relationship modeling\nto capture denser supervisions.

In this Letter, we present a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis of the effects of both temporally\nuncorrelated and correlated quantum noises on entanglement generation and\ninformation protection. This investigation reveals that entanglement within the\nsystem follows $q^{-1/3}$ scaling for both types of quantum noises, where $q$\nrepresents the noise probability. The scaling arises from the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuation with effective length scale $L_{\\text{eff}}\n\\sim q^{-1}$. More importantly, the information protection timescales of the\nsteady states are explored and shown to follow $q^{-1/2}$ and $q^{-2/3}$\nscaling for temporally uncorrelated and correlated noises, respectively. The\nformer scaling can be interpreted as a Hayden-Preskill protocol, while the\nlatter is a direct consequence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. We conduct\nextensive numerical simulations using stabilizer formalism to support the\ntheoretical understanding. This Letter not only contributes to a deeper\nunderstanding of the interplay between quantum noises and measurement-induced\nphase transition but also provides a new perspective to understand the effects\nof Markovian and non-Markovian noises on quantum computation.",

We construct exact solutions of the considered model using a\nrecently developed expansion technique. This current proposed technique has\nbeen successfully implemented to obtain a few exact solutions of a new formed\n(2+1)-dimensional BKP equation. In order to understand the physical\ninterpretation of solutions effectively, the 2D and 3D graphs are plotted for\neach type of the solutions obtained for different particular values of the\nparameters. Furthermore, it is found that the obtained solutions are periodic\nand solitary wave solutions. We anticipate that the proposed method is reliable\nand can be applied for obtaining wave solutions of the other nonlinear\nevolution equations (NLEEs).",

The ability to arbitrarily engineer their resonant frequencies is\ncrucial for exploring novel physics in synthetic frequency dimensions and\npractical applications like nonlinear optical parametric processes and\ndispersion-engineered frequency comb generation. Photonic crystal ring (PhCR)\nresonators are a versatile tool for such arbitrary frequency engineering, by\ncontrollably creating mode splitting at selected resonances. To date, these\nPhCRs have mostly been demonstrated in isotropic photonic materials, while such\nengineering could be significantly more complicated in anisotropic platforms\nthat often offer more fruitful optical properties. Here, we realize the\nspectral engineering of chip-scale optical microresonators in the anisotropic\nlithium niobate (LN) crystal by a gradient design that precisely compensates\nfor variations in both refractive index and perturbation strength. We\nexperimentally demonstrate controllable frequency splitting at single and\nmultiple selected resonances in LN PhCR resonators with different sizes, while\nmaintaining high Q-factors up to 1 million. Moreover, we experimentally\nconstruct a sharp boundary in the synthetic frequency dimension based on an\nactively modulated x-cut LN gradient-PhCR, opening up new paths toward the\narbitrary control of electro-optic comb spectral shapes and exploration of\nnovel physics in the frequency degree of freedom.",

                "summary": "In the healthcare domain, summarizing medical questions posed by patients is\ncritical for improving doctor-patient interactions and medical decision-making.\nAlthough medical data has grown in complexity and quantity, the current body of\nresearch in this domain has primarily concentrated on text-based methods,\noverlooking the integration of visual cues. Also prior works in the area of\nmedical question summarisation have been limited to the English language. This\nwork introduces the task of multimodal medical question summarization for\ncodemixed input in a low-resource setting. To address this gap, we introduce\nthe Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization MMCQS dataset, which\ncombines Hindi-English codemixed medical queries with visual aids. This\nintegration enriches the representation of a patient's medical condition,\nproviding a more comprehensive perspective. We also propose a framework named\nMedSumm that leverages the power of LLMs and VLMs for this task. By utilizing\nour MMCQS dataset, we demonstrate the value of integrating visual information\nfrom images to improve the creation of medically detailed summaries. This\nmultimodal strategy not only improves healthcare decision-making but also\npromotes a deeper comprehension of patient queries, paving the way for future\nexploration in personalized and responsive medical care. Our dataset, code, and\npre-trained models will be made publicly available.",

In addition, the number of Distributed\nEnergy Resources (DER) and Microgrids (MGs) is increasing on a global scale to\nmeet the energy demand, consequently changing the energy infrastructure.\nRecently, energy-sharing methods have been proposed to share excess energy from\nDERs and EVs in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI) and MGs.\nAccommodating this sharing mechanism with the existing electrical distribution\nsystems is a critical issue concerning the economic, reliability, and\nresilience aspects. This study examines the ever-changing field of EVCI and the\ncritical role of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in mitigating the problems\nwith grid management that result from unorganized EV charging and intermittency\nin DER. Also, the possibility of energy sharing in electrical distribution\nsystems for microgrids and EVCI on various energy-sharing methods and\nalgorithms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the application of market\nclearing algorithms like game theory, double auction theory, blockchain\ntechnology, optimization techniques, machine learning algorithms, and other\nmodels from the existing literature are presented. This paper discusses the\npolicies, economic benefits, environmental impacts, societal advantages, and\nchallenges in distribution systems related to sharing in EVCI and MGs. A\nroadmap for future research and sharing strategies is provided to guide\npolicymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders toward a sustainable,\nresilient, and efficient energy market by integrating P2P technology into EVCIs\nand MGs.",

                "summary": "Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new\nclasses based on very limited training data without forgetting the old ones\nencountered. Existing studies solely relied on pure visual networks, while in\nthis paper we solved FSCIL by leveraging the Vision-Language model (e.g., CLIP)\nand propose a simple yet effective framework, named Learning Prompt with\nDistribution-based Feature Replay (LP-DiF). We observe that simply using CLIP\nfor zero-shot evaluation can substantially outperform the most influential\nmethods. Then, prompt tuning technique is involved to further improve its\nadaptation ability, allowing the model to continually capture specific\nknowledge from each session. To prevent the learnable prompt from forgetting\nold knowledge in the new session, we propose a pseudo-feature replay approach.\nSpecifically, we preserve the old knowledge of each class by maintaining a\nfeature-level Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, which is\nestimated by the image features of training images and synthesized features\ngenerated from a VAE. When progressing to a new session, pseudo-features are\nsampled from old-class distributions combined with training images of the\ncurrent session to optimize the prompt, thus enabling the model to learn new\nknowledge while retaining old knowledge. Experiments on three prevalent\nbenchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100, mini-ImageNet, CUB-200, and two more challenging\nbenchmarks, i.e., SUN-397 and CUB-200$^*$ proposed in this paper showcase the\nsuperiority of LP-DiF, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in FSCIL.

                "summary": "We have conducted a theoretical investigation of the topological phenomena\nassociated with chiral superconducting pairing states induced in a doped\nKane-Mele model on a honeycomb lattice. Through numerical analysis, we have\nobtained exotic phase diagrams for both the $d+id$ and $p+ip$ superconducting\nstates. In the case of the $d+id$ pairing state, higher Chern number states\nwith $\\left| C \\right| = \\pm 4$ emerge. The Chern number decreases as the\nspin-orbit coupling is introduced. For the $p+ip$ pairing state, additional\nphase transition lines are present in the overdoped region near the Van Hove\nsingularity point, leading to the emergence of higher Chern number phases with\n$\\left| C \\right| = \\pm 6$. These higher Chern number phases are further\nverified through the bulk-edge correspondence. To understand the origin of the\nexotic topological phase diagrams in the chiral superconducting state, we have\nexamined the electronic structure at the phase transition lines. This\ninvestigation provides insight into the complex interplay between chiral\nsuperconductivity and topological properties, potentially paving the way for\nthe discovery of new materials with unique topological properties.",

                "summary": "In this work, we discuss how the linear and non-linear advection terms modify\nthe scaling behavior of the continuous symmetry breaking and stabilize the\nlong-range order, even in $d=2$ far from equilibrium, by means of simple\nscaling arguments. For an example of the liner advection, we consider the\n$O(n)$ model in the steady shear. Our scaling analysis reveals that the model\ncan undergo the continuous symmetry breaking even in $d=2$ and, moreover,\npredicts the upper critical dimension $d_{\\rm up}=2$. These results are fully\nconsistent with a recent numerical simulation of the $O(2)$ model, where the\nmean-field critical exponents are observed even in $d=2$. For an example of the\nnon-linear advection, we consider the Toner-Tu hydrodynamic theory, which was\nintroduced to explain polar-ordered flocks, such as the Vicsek model. Our\nsimple scaling argument reproduces the previous results by the dynamical\nrenormalization theory. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of the additional\nnon-linear terms discovered by the recent re-analysis of the hydrodynamic\nequation. Our scaling argument predicts that the additional non-linear terms\nmodify the scaling exponents and, in particular, recover the isotropic scaling\nreported in a previous numerical simulation of the Vicsek model. We discuss\nthat the critical exponents predicted by the naive scaling theory become exact\nin $d=2$ by using a symmetry consideration and similar argument proposed by\nToner and Tu.",

                "summary": "An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source\npopulations. Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events,\noriginating in presumed coronal reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep\npower laws of A/Q, where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge. Since\nthermal electron energies are enhanced and nonthermal electron distributions\narise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge states Q\nwould be increased through ionization interactions with those electron\npopulations during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the\nSEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the\nactual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through\nthe corona. We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would\ndiffer with various kappa values in a kappa function representing high-energy\ntail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that the\ndifferences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme kappa distribution\nare about 10-30%. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a\nfunction of their A/Q with various kappa values. Then, we find that the derived\nsource region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the\nelectron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal,\ndistribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region,\nthe agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active\nregion temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the\nacceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization time scale.",

                "title": "A proposal for a minimal model of free reed",
                "summary": "In this paper we propose a minimal model for free reeds taking into account\nthe significant phenomena. This free reed model may be used to build models of\nfree reed instruments which permit numerical simulations. Several definitions\nfor the section by which the airflow passes through the reed are reviewed and a\nnew one is proposed which takes into account the entire escape area under the\nreed and the reed thickness. To derive this section, it is necessary to\ndistinguish the neutral section (the only section of the reed which always\nkeeps its length constant while moving) from the upstream or downstream\nsections. A minimal configuration is chosen to permit the instabilities of both\n(-,+) and (+,-) reeds on the basis of a linear analysis of instabilities\nconditions. This configuration is used to illustrate, with temporal\nsimulations, the minimal model for both kinds of reeds and to discuss the model\nassumptions. Some clues are given about the influence, on the playing frequency\nand on the dynamic of the sound, of two main parameters of the geometrical\nmodel: the size of the volume and the level of the excitation. It is shown that\nthe playing frequency of a (+,-) reed can vary in a large range according to\nthe size of the volume upstream of the reed; that the playing frequency is\nnearly independent of the excitation but that the dynamic of the sound\nincreases with the excitation level. Some clues are also proposed to determine\nthe nature of the bifurcation for free reeds: it seems that free reeds may\npresent inverse bifurcations. The influence of the reed thickness is also\nstudied for configurations where the reed length or the reed width vary to keep\nthe mass constant. This study shows that the reed thickness can have a great\ninfluence on the sound magnitude, the playing frequency and the magnitude of\nthe reed displacement which justifies its introduction in the reed model.This\narticle has been published in Acta Acustica united with Acustica, Vol. 93\n(2007), p. 122-144.",

Based on interferences between the\nsuccessive delayed and amplified output signals associated respectively with\nthe impulses constituting the input signal, the taches-algorithm can give\naccess immediately to the new output sample and have a low latency response\neven without using vector-based optimisation of the calculation. With the\ntaches-algorithm it seems easy to change (even in real-time) the impulse\nresponse while running the calculation, simply by updating the impulse response\nto use it for next samples, a task rather difficult to achieve using FFT\nconvolution. Real-time audio demonstrations using notably Pure Data and simple\nexplanations of the taches-algorithm will be given.Paper 7412 presented at the\n125th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society, Amsterdam, 2008",

                "summary": "During the last decade, wireless data services have had an incredible impact\non people's lives in ways we could never have imagined. The number of mobile\ndevices has increased exponentially and data traffic has almost doubled every\nyear. Undoubtedly, the rate of growth will continue to be rapid with the\nexplosive increase in demands for data rates, latency, massive connectivity,\nnetwork reliability, and energy efficiency. In order to manage this level of\ngrowth and meet these requirements, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile\ncommunications network is envisioned as a revolutionary advancement combining\nvarious improvements to previous mobile generation networks and new\ntechnologies, including the use of millimeter wavebands (mm-wave), massive\nmultiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) multi-beam antennas, network\ndensification, dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission, and new\nwaveforms with mixed numerologies. New revolutionary features including\nterahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks\n(NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G\nnetworks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key\ntechnologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and\nbeyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates\nsignificant interference that needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, it is\nessential to design effective interference management schemes to mitigate\nsevere and sometimes unpredictable interference in mobile networks. In this\npaper, we provide a comprehensive review of interference management in 5G and\nBeyond networks and discuss its future evolution. We start with a unified\nclassification and a detailed explanation of the different types of\ninterference and continue by presenting our taxonomy of existing interference\nmanagement approaches. Then, after explaining interference measurement reports\nand signaling, we provide for each type of interference identified, an in-depth\nliterature review and technical discussion of appropriate management schemes.\nWe finish by discussing the main interference challenges that will be\nencountered in future 6G networks and by presenting insights on the suggested\nnew interference management approaches, including useful guidelines for an\nAI-based solution. This review will provide a first-hand guide to the industry\nin determining the most relevant technology for interference management, and\nwill also allow for consideration of future challenges and research directions.",

In this study, we introduce\na comprehensive probabilistic model of power distribution in beamspace, and\nformulate the joint optimization problem of probing beam selection and\nprobabilistic beam prediction as an entropy minimization problem. Then, we\npropose a greedy scheme to iteratively and alternately solve this problem,\nwhere a transformer-based beam predictor is trained to estimate the conditional\npower distribution based on the probing beams and user location within each\niteration, and the trained predictor selects an unmeasured beam that minimizes\nthe entropy of remaining beams. To further reduce the number of interactions\nand the computational complexity of the iterative scheme, we propose a\ntwo-stage probing beam selection scheme. Firstly, probing beams are selected\nfrom a location-specific codebook designed by an entropy-based criterion, and\npredictions are made with corresponding feedback. Secondly, the optimal beam is\nidentified using additional probing beams with the highest predicted power\nvalues. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes\ncompared to hierarchical beam search and beam prediction with uniform probing\nbeams.",

Recently, the singularity of a\nnon-Hermitian system, known as the exceptional point (EP), has drawn much\nattention for this goal. Response of the eigenfrequency shift to a perturbation\n$\\epsilon$ follows the $\\epsilon^{1/n}$-dependence at an $n$th-order EP,\nleading to significantly enhanced sensitivity via a high-order EP. However, due\nto the requirement of increasingly complicated systems, great difficulties will\noccur along the path of increasing the EP order to enhance the sensitivity.\nHere we report that by utilizing the spectral anomaly of the coherent perfect\nabsorption (CPA), the sensitivity at a third-order EP can be further enhanced\nowing to the cooperative effects of both CPA and EP. We realize this\nsynthetically enhanced sensor using a pseudo-Hermitian cavity magnonic system\ncomposed of two yttrium iron garnet spheres and a microwave cavity. The\ndetectable minimum change of the magnetic field reaches $4.2\\times10^{-21}$T.\nIt opens a new avenue to design novel sensors using hybrid non-Hermitian\nquantum systems.",

In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V\nas a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to\ncomplete tasks on any given website. We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent\nthat harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting\non the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark. In addition to\nstandard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online\nevaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live\nwebsites. We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents -- it\ncan successfully complete 51.1 of the tasks on live websites if we manually\nground its textual plans into actions on the websites. This substantially\noutperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2)\nspecifically fine-tuned for web agents. However, grounding still remains a\nmajor challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting\nturns out to be not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy\nwe develop in this paper leverages both the HTML structure and visuals. Yet,\nthere is still a substantial gap with oracle grounding, leaving ample room for\nfurther improvement.

Such a setting is characteristic of several practical QKD\nprotocols. Due to non-orthogonality, the receiver is not able to discriminate\nunambiguously between the signals. To understand the fundamental limits that\nthis imposes, the quantity of interest is the maximum mutual information\nbetween the transmitter (Alice) and the receiver, whether legitimate (Bob) or\nan eavesdropper (Eve). To find the optimal measurement we use a framework based\non operator algebra and general results derived from singular value\ndecomposition, achieving optimal solutions for von Neumann measurements and\npositive operator-valued measures (POVMs). The formal proof and quantitative\nanalysis elaborated for two signals allow one to conclude that optimal von\nNeumann measurements are uniquely defined and provide a higher information gain\ncompared to POVMs. Interestingly, collective measurements not only do not\nprovide additional information gain with respect to individual ones, but also\nsuffer from a gain reduction in the case of POVMs.",

Studies of MEV\nhave thus far largely been restricted to purely on-chain MEV, i.e., sandwich\nattacks, cyclic arbitrage, and liquidations. In this work, we shed light on the\nprevalence of non-atomic arbitrage on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the\nEthereum blockchain. Importantly, non-atomic arbitrage exploits price\ndifferences between DEXes on the Ethereum blockchain as well as exchanges\noutside the Ethereum blockchain (i.e., centralized exchanges or DEXes on other\nblockchains). Thus, non-atomic arbitrage is a type of MEV that involves actions\non and off the Ethereum blockchain.\n  In our study of non-atomic arbitrage, we uncover that more than a fourth of\nthe volume on Ethereum's biggest five DEXes from the merge until 31 October\n2023 can likely be attributed to this type of MEV. We further highlight that\nonly eleven searchers are responsible for more than 80% of the identified\nnon-atomic arbitrage volume sitting at a staggering $132 billion and draw a\nconnection between the centralization of the block construction market and\nnon-atomic arbitrage. Finally, we discuss the security implications of these\nhigh-value transactions that account for more than 10% of Ethereum's total\nblock value and outline possible mitigations.",

                "summary": "Creativity serves as a cornerstone for societal progress and innovation. With\nthe rise of advanced generative AI models capable of tasks once reserved for\nhuman creativity, the study of AI's creative potential becomes imperative for\nits responsible development and application. In this paper, we prove in theory\nthat AI can be as creative as humans under the condition that it can properly\nfit the data generated by human creators. Therefore, the debate on AI's\ncreativity is reduced into the question of its ability to fit a sufficient\namount of data. To arrive at this conclusion, this paper first addresses the\ncomplexities in defining creativity by introducing a new concept called\nRelative Creativity. Rather than attempting to define creativity universally,\nwe shift the focus to whether AI can match the creative abilities of a\nhypothetical human. The methodological shift leads to a statistically\nquantifiable assessment of AI's creativity, term Statistical Creativity. This\nconcept, statistically comparing the creative abilities of AI with those of\nspecific human groups, facilitates theoretical exploration of AI's creative\npotential. Our analysis reveals that by fitting extensive conditional data\nwithout marginalizing out the generative conditions, AI can emerge as a\nhypothetical new creator. The creator possesses the same creative abilities on\npar with the human creators it was trained on. Building on theoretical\nfindings, we discuss the application in prompt-conditioned autoregressive\nmodels, providing a practical means for evaluating creative abilities of\ngenerative AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, this\nstudy provides an actionable training guideline, bridging the theoretical\nquantification of creativity with practical model training.",

For the existing RGB-T semantic segmentation methods, however,\nthe effective exploration of the complementary relationship between different\nmodalities is not implemented in the information interaction between multiple\nlevels. To address such an issue, the Context-Aware Interaction Network\n(CAINet) is proposed for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which constructs\ninteraction space to exploit auxiliary tasks and global context for explicitly\nguided learning. Specifically, we propose a Context-Aware Complementary\nReasoning (CACR) module aimed at establishing the complementary relationship\nbetween multimodal features with the long-term context in both spatial and\nchannel dimensions. Further, considering the importance of global contextual\nand detailed information, we propose the Global Context Modeling (GCM) module\nand Detail Aggregation (DA) module, and we introduce specific auxiliary\nsupervision to explicitly guide the context interaction and refine the\nsegmentation map. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets of MFNet and\nPST900 demonstrate that the proposed CAINet achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.

                "summary": "Anomaly detection on attributed networks aims to find the nodes whose\nbehaviors are significantly different from other majority nodes. Generally,\nnetwork data contains information about relationships between entities, and the\nanomaly is usually embodied in these relationships. Therefore, how to\ncomprehensively model complex interaction patterns in networks is still a major\nfocus. It can be observed that anomalies in networks violate the homophily\nassumption. However, most existing studies only considered this phenomenon\nobliquely rather than explicitly. Besides, the node representation of normal\nentities can be perturbed easily by the noise relationships introduced by\nanomalous nodes. To address the above issues, we present a novel contrastive\nlearning framework for anomaly detection on attributed networks,\n\\textbf{SCALA}, aiming to improve the embedding quality of the network and\nprovide a new measurement of qualifying the anomaly score for each node by\nintroducing sparsification into the conventional method. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on five benchmark real-world datasets and the results show that\nSCALA consistently outperforms all baseline methods significantly.",

                "summary": "The study of Graph Neural Networks has received considerable interest in the\npast few years. By extending deep learning to graph-structured data, GNNs can\nsolve a diverse set of tasks in fields including social science, chemistry, and\nmedicine. The development of GNN architectures has largely been focused on\nimproving empirical performance on tasks like node or graph classification.\nHowever, a line of recent work has instead sought to find GNN architectures\nthat have desirable theoretical properties - by studying their expressive power\nand designing architectures that maximize this expressiveness.\n  While there is no consensus on the best way to define the expressiveness of a\nGNN, it can be viewed from several well-motivated perspectives. Perhaps the\nmost natural approach is to study the universal approximation properties of\nGNNs, much in the way that this has been studied extensively for MLPs. Another\ndirection focuses on the extent to which GNNs can distinguish between different\ngraph structures, relating this to the graph isomorphism test. Besides, a GNN's\nability to compute graph properties such as graph moments has been suggested as\nanother form of expressiveness. All of these different definitions are\ncomplementary and have yielded different recommendations for GNN architecture\nchoices. In this paper, we would like to give an overview of the notion of\n\"expressive power\" of GNNs and provide some valuable insights regarding the\ndesign choices of GNNs.",

                "summary": "Defining a successful notion of a multivariate quantile has been an open\nproblem for more than half a century, motivating a plethora of possible\nsolutions. Of these, the approach of [8] and [25] leading to M-quantiles, is\nvery appealing for its mathematical elegance combining elements of convex\nanalysis and probability theory. The key idea is the description of a convex\nfunction (the K-function) whose gradient (the K-transform) is in one-to-one\ncorrespondence between all of R^d and the unit ball in R^d. By analogy with the\nd=1 case where the K-transform is a cumulative distribution function-like\nobject (an M-distribution), the fact that its inverse is guaranteed to exist\nlends itself naturally to providing the basis for the definition of a quantile\nfunction for all d>=1. Over the past twenty years the resulting M-quantiles\nhave seen applications in a variety of fields, primarily for the purpose of\ndetecting outliers in multidimensional spaces. In this article we prove that\nfor odd d>=3, it is not the gradient but a poly-Laplacian of the K-function\nthat is (almost everywhere) proportional to the density function. For d even\none cannot establish a differential equation connecting the K-function with the\ndensity. These results show that usage of the K-transform for outlier detection\nin higher odd-dimensions is in principle flawed, as the K-transform does not\noriginate from inversion of a true M-distribution. We demonstrate these\nconclusions in two dimensions through examples from non-standard asymmetric\ndistributions. Our examples illustrate a feature of the K-transform whereby\nregions in the domain with higher density map to larger volumes in the\nco-domain, thereby producing a magnification effect that moves inliers closer\nto the boundary of the co-domain than outliers. This feature obviously disrupts\nany outlier detection mechanism that relies on the inverse K-transform.",

First, motivated by an old problem of van\nDouwen, we construct from CH a locally compact and locally countable first\ncountable PNC space with countable spread. A space is deemed \"densely countably\ncompact\", denoted as DCC for brevity, if it possesses a dense, countable\ncompact subspace. Moreover, a space qualifies as \"densely relatively countably\ncompact\", abbreviated as DRC, if it contains a dense subset $D$ such that every\ninfinite subset of $D$ has an accumulation point in $X$. A countably compact\nspace is DCC, a DCC space is DRC, and a DRC space is evidently pseudocompact.\nThe Tychonoff plank is a DCC space but is not countably compact. A $\\Psi$-space\nbelongs to the class of DRC spaces but is not DCC. Lastly, if $p\\in {\\omega}^*$\nis not a P-point, then $T(p)$, representing the type of $p$ in ${\\omega}^*$,\nconstitutes a pseudocompact subspace of ${\\omega}^*$ that is not \\DRC. When\nconsidering a topological property denoted as $Q$, we define a space $X$ as\n\"hereditarily $Q$\" if every regular closed subspace of $X$ also possesses\nproperty $Q$. The Tychonoff plank and the $\\Psi$-spaces are not hereditary\nexamples. However, the aforementioned space $T(p)$ is a hereditary example,\nalbeit not being first countable.\n  In this paper we want to find (first countable) examples which separates\nthese properties hereditarily. We have obtained the following result.\n  (1) There is a DCC space $X$ such that no $H\\in RC(X)^+$ is countably\ncompact.\n  (2) If CH holds, then there is a DRC space $Y$ such that no $H\\in RC(Y)^+$ is\nDCC.\n  (3) If CH holds, then there is a first countable pseudocompact space $Z$ such\nthat no $H\\in RC(Z)^+$ is DRC.",

                "summary": "Consumer-resource dynamics is central in determining biomass transport across\necosystems. The assumptions of mass action, chemostatic conditions and\nstationarity in stochastic feeding dynamics lead to Holling type II functional\nresponses, whose use is widespread in macroscopic models of population\ndynamics. However, to be useful for parameter inference, stochastic population\nmodels need to be identifiable, this meaning that model parameters can be\nuniquely inferred from a large number of model observations. In this\ncontribution we study parameter identifiability in a multi-resource\nconsumer-resource model, for which we can obtain the steady-state and\nout-of-equilibrium probability distributions of predator's abundances by\nanalytically solving the master equation. Based on these analytical results, we\ncan conduct in silico experiments by tracking the abundance of consumers that\nare either searching for or handling prey, data then used for maximum\nlikelihood parameter estimation. We show that, when model observations are\nrecorded out of equilibrium, feeding parameters are truly identifiable, whereas\nif sampling is done at stationarity, only ratios of rates can be inferred from\ndata. We discuss the implications of our results when inferring parameters of\ngeneral dynamical models.",

This work studies three\nquantum-verifier based generalizations of $\\mathsf{PH}$, two of which are from\n[Gharibian, Santha, Sikora, Sundaram, Yirka, 2022] and use classical strings\n($\\mathsf{QCPH}$) and quantum mixed states ($\\mathsf{QPH}$) as proofs, and one\nof which is new to this work, utilizing quantum pure states\n($\\mathsf{pureQPH}$) as proofs. We first resolve several open problems from\n[GSSSY22], including a collapse theorem and a Karp-Lipton theorem for\n$\\mathsf{QCPH}$. Then, for our new class $\\mathsf{pureQPH}$, we show one-sided\nerror reduction for $\\mathsf{pureQPH}$, as well as the first bounds relating\nthese quantum variants of $\\mathsf{PH}$, namely $\\mathsf{QCPH}\\subseteq\n\\mathsf{pureQPH} \\subseteq \\mathsf{EXP}^{\\mathsf{PP}}$.",

                "summary": "Wireless communication highly depends on the cellular ground base station\n(GBS). A failure of the cellular GBS, fully or partially, during natural or\nman-made disasters creates a communication gap in the disaster-affected areas.\nIn such situations, public safety communication (PSC) can significantly save\nthe national infrastructure, property, and lives. Throughout emergencies, the\nPSC can provide mission-critical communication and video transmission services\nin the affected area. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations\n(UAV-BSs) are particularly suitable for PSC services as they are flexible,\nmobile, and easily deployable. This manuscript considers a multi-UAV-assisted\nPSC network with an observational UAV receiving videos from the affected area's\nground users (AGUs) and transmitting them to the nearby GBS via a relay UAV.\nThe objective of the proposed study is to maximize the average utility of the\nvideo streams generated by the AGUs upon reaching the GBS. This is achieved by\noptimizing the positions of the observational and relay UAVs, as well as the\ndistribution of communication resources, such as bandwidth, and transmit power,\nwhile satisfying the system-designed constraints, such as transmission rate,\nrate outage probability, transmit power budget, and available bandwidth. To\nthis end, a joint UAVs placement and resource allocation problem is\nmathematically formulated. The proposed problem poses a significant challenge\nfor a solution. Considering the block coordinate descent and successive convex\napproximation techniques, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed.\nFinally, simulation results are provided which show that our proposed approach\noutperforms the existing methods.",

While previous\nresearch has focused on generating captions for general images, incorporating\nbrand personalities into social media captioning remains unexplored. Brand\npersonalities are shown to be affecting consumers' behaviours and social\ninteractions and thus are proven to be a key aspect of marketing strategies.\nCurrent open-source multimodal LLMs are not directly suited for this task.\nHence, we propose a pipeline solution to assist brands in creating engaging\nsocial media captions that align with the image and the brand personalities.\nOur architecture is based on two parts: a the first part contains an image\ncaptioning model that takes in an image that the brand wants to post online and\ngives a plain English caption; b the second part takes in the generated caption\nalong with the target brand personality and outputs a catchy\npersonality-aligned social media caption. Along with brand personality, our\nsystem also gives users the flexibility to provide hashtags, Instagram handles,\nURLs, and named entities they want the caption to contain, making the captions\nmore semantically related to the social media handles. Comparative evaluations\nagainst various baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively.",

The PandaX-4T dark\nmatter detector is employed to monitor the temporal evolution of radon\nactivity. To determine the radon reduction factor, the experimental data of\nradon atoms introduced into and bypassed the distillation system is compared.\nThe results indicate that the PandaX-4T distillation system achieves a radon\nreduction factor exceeding 190 at the flow rate of 10 slpm and the reflux ratio\nof 1.44. Gas-only online distillation process of a flow rate of 20 slpm is also\nconducted without observing significant reduction of radon levels in the\ndetector. This observation suggests that the migration flow of radon atoms from\nthe liquid phase to the gas phase is limited, and the flow rate of gas\ncirculation and duration of the process are insignificant compared to the total\nxenon mass of 5.6 tons in the detector. This study provides the experimental\ndata to support the efficient removal of radon at $\\sim$Bq level using the\nPandaX-4T distillation system, which is the prerequisite of the radon\nbackground control in the detector. The further operation with higher flow rate\nwill be applied for the upcoming science run in PandaX-4T.",

The latter permits\nefficient annihilation of light scalar DM into leptonic final states including\nright-handed neutrinos (RHN). While DM annihilation into charged lepton final\nstates is kept either suppressed or in a kinematically forbidden ballpark to\navoid cosmic microwave background (CMB) bounds, the RHN, active neutrino final\nstates remain safe from such bounds even if they are allowed kinematically. We\ndiscuss the interplay of forbidden and non-forbidden channels in generating\nlight thermal DM relic while incorporating constraints from cosmology as well\nas laboratory experiments. The model can also explain the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of muon, W-mass anomaly and saturate experimental bounds on charged\nlepton flavour violation and DM direct detection while offering tantalising\ndetection prospects of the lightest RHN, the mass of which is kept in the same\nballpark as DM.",

While the amodal segmentation task is to predict the\ncomplete mask of partially occluded objects, it is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive to annotate the pixel-level ground truth amodal masks.\nBox-level supervised amodal segmentation addresses this challenge by relying\nsolely on ground truth bounding boxes and instance classes as supervision,\nthereby alleviating the need for exhaustive pixel-level annotations.\nNevertheless, current box-level methodologies encounter limitations in\ngenerating low-resolution masks and imprecise boundaries, failing to meet the\ndemands of practical real-world applications. We present a novel solution to\ntackle this problem by introducing a directed expansion approach from visible\nmasks to corresponding amodal masks. Our approach involves a hybrid end-to-end\nnetwork based on the overlapping region - the area where different instances\nintersect. Diverse segmentation strategies are applied for overlapping regions\nand non-overlapping regions according to distinct characteristics. To guide the\nexpansion of visible masks, we introduce an elaborately-designed connectivity\nloss for overlapping regions, which leverages correlations with visible masks\nand facilitates accurate amodal segmentation. Experiments are conducted on\nseveral challenging datasets and the results show that our proposed method can\noutperform existing state-of-the-art methods with large margins.",

However, previous studies primarily view these as\nindependent parallel tasks, lacking an integrated multitask learning framework.\nThis work introduces a solution, the Single-branch Semantic Stereo Network\n(S3Net), which innovatively combines semantic segmentation and stereo matching\nusing Self-Fuse and Mutual-Fuse modules. Unlike preceding methods that utilize\nsemantic or disparity information independently, our method dentifies and\nleverages the intrinsic link between these two tasks, leading to a more\naccurate understanding of semantic information and disparity estimation.\nComparative testing on the US3D dataset proves the effectiveness of our S3Net.\nOur model improves the mIoU in semantic segmentation from 61.38 to 67.39, and\nreduces the D1-Error and average endpoint error (EPE) in disparity estimation\nfrom 10.051 to 9.579 and 1.439 to 1.403 respectively, surpassing existing\ncompetitive methods.

Despite\nadvantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive\nredundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and\ncompact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated\ninformation blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images\n(WSIs) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic\ndata, leading to an ``intra-modal redundancy\" issue. (2) Duplicated information\namong modalities dominates the representation of multimodal data, which makes\nmodality-specific information prone to being ignored, resulting in an\n``inter-modal redundancy\" issue. To address these, we propose a new framework,\nPrototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling (PIBD), consisting of\nPrototypical Information Bottleneck (PIB) module for intra-modal redundancy and\nPrototypical Information Disentanglement (PID) module for inter-modal\nredundancy. Specifically, a variant of information bottleneck, PIB, is proposed\nto model prototypes approximating a bunch of instances for different risk\nlevels, which can be used for selection of discriminative instances within\nmodality. PID module decouples entangled multimodal data into compact distinct\ncomponents: modality-common and modality-specific knowledge, under the guidance\nof the joint prototypical distribution.

                "summary": "Advances in image diffusion models have recently led to notable improvements\nin the generation of high-quality images. In combination with Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRFs), they enabled new opportunities in 3D generation. However, most\ngenerative 3D approaches are object-centric and applying them to editing\nexisting photorealistic scenes is not trivial. We propose SIGNeRF, a novel\napproach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated\nobject generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency\nacross the edited images, without requiring iterative optimization. We find\nthat depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to\ngenerate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single\nviews. Based on these insights, we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of\nmodified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on\nthe reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated\nimage set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the\nimage diffusion model, we gain fine control over the spatial location of the\nedit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh.",

The concept of\nrelatively countably compact subspaces were explored by Marjanovic to show that\na $\\Psi$-space is pseudocompact.\n  A topological space is said to be DRC (DRS) iff it possesses a dense,\nrelatively countably compact (or relatively sequentially compact, respectively)\nsubspace.\n  The concept of selectively pseudocompact game Sp(X) and the selectively\nsequentially pseudocompact game Ssp(X) were introduced by Dorantes-Aldama and\nShakhmatov. They explored the relationship between the existence of a winning\nstrategy and a stationary winning strategy for player P in these games. In\nparticular, they observed that there exists a stationary winning strategy in\nthe game Sp(X) (Ssp(X)) for Player P iff $X$ is DRC (or DRS, respectively).\n  In this paper we introduce natural weakening of the properties DRC and DRS: a\nspace $X$ is DRCo ( DRSo) iff there is a sequence $(D_n:n \\in { \\omega})$ of\ndense subsets of $X$ such that every sequence $(d_n:n \\in { \\omega} )$ with\n$d_n \\in D_n$ has an accumulation point (or contains a convergent subsequence,\nrespectively).\n  These properties are also equivalent to the existence of some limited\nknowledge winning strategy on the corresponding games $Sp(X)$ and $Ssp(X)$.\n  Clearly, DRS implies DRC and DRSo, DRC or DRSo imply DRCo. The main part of\nthis paper is devoted to prove that apart from these trivial implications,\nconsistently there are no other implications between these properties.",

It has attracted\ngrowing attention in recent years, where existing approaches focus on\nself-training that usually includes pseudo-labeling techniques. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel noise-learning approach tailored to address noise\ndistribution in domain adaptation settings and learn to de-confuse the\npseudo-labels. More specifically, we learn a noise transition matrix of the\npseudo-labels to capture the label corruption of each class and learn the\nunderlying true label distribution. Estimating the noise transition matrix\nenables a better true class-posterior estimation, resulting in better\nprediction accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when\ncombined with several source-free domain adaptation methods: SHOT, SHOT++, and\nAaD.

This paper\nintroduces AIGCBench, a pioneering comprehensive and scalable benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate a variety of video generation tasks, with a primary focus\non Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. AIGCBench tackles the limitations of\nexisting benchmarks, which suffer from a lack of diverse datasets, by including\na varied and open-domain image-text dataset that evaluates different\nstate-of-the-art algorithms under equivalent conditions. We employ a novel text\ncombiner and GPT-4 to create rich text prompts, which are then used to generate\nimages via advanced Text-to-Image models. To establish a unified evaluation\nframework for video generation tasks, our benchmark includes 11 metrics\nspanning four dimensions to assess algorithm performance. These dimensions are\ncontrol-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video\nquality. These metrics are both reference video-dependent and video-free,\nensuring a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The evaluation standard proposed\ncorrelates well with human judgment, providing insights into the strengths and\nweaknesses of current I2V algorithms. The findings from our extensive\nexperiments aim to stimulate further research and development in the I2V field.\nAIGCBench represents a significant step toward creating standardized benchmarks\nfor the broader AIGC landscape, proposing an adaptable and equitable framework\nfor future assessments of video generation tasks.

                "summary": "In mobile networks, Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) provides a framework for\nimplementing network slicing that interacts with the resources at the lower\nlayers. Both monitoring and Radio Access Network (RAN) control is feasible for\nboth 4G and 5G systems. In this work, we consider how data-driven resource\nallocation in a 4G context can enable adaptive slice allocation to steer the\nexperienced latency of Virtual Reality (VR) traffic towards a requested\nlatency. We develop an xApp for the near real-time RAN Intelligent Controller\n(RIC) that embeds a heuristic algorithm for latency control, aiming to: (1)\nmaintain latency of a VR stream around a requested value; and (2) improve the\navailable RAN allocation to offer higher bit rate to another user. We have\nexperimentally demonstrated the proposed approach in an ORAN testbed. Our\nresults show that the data-driven approach can dynamically follow the variation\nof the traffic load while satisfying the required latency. This results in\n15.8% more resources to secondary users than a latency-equivalent static\nallocation.",

The quantum fields modeling the\nHawking radiation have a scale and are consistently inherited from a conformal\nparent theory; their symmetries are thus compatible with those of curved\nbackgrounds. We demonstrate explicitly that the existence of islands is\nsensitive to the choice of CFT used to model the Hawking radiation. We compute\nthe renormalised entanglement entropy of conformal fields on a negatively\ncurved background in $d$ dimensions at zero temperature as well as the thermal\nregulated entropy of an entangling region near the UV boundary. Using the\nlatter quantity as the entropy of the Hawking radiation, we find that islands\nnever emerge for $d>2$.",

However, obtaining labeled data for\ntraining is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, it is crucial to develop\neffective algorithms in situations with limited labeled samples. In this work,\nwe propose a label-efficient deep learning method with self-ensembling (LESEN).\nLESEN incorporates supervised and unsupervised losses, enabling the student and\nteacher models to mutually learn from each other, forming a self-ensembling\nmean teacher framework. Additionally, we introduce a reliable unlabeled sample\nselection (RUSS) mechanism to further enhance LESEN's effectiveness. Our\nexperiments on the human connectome project (HCP) dataset demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our method when compared to state-of-the-art\ntechniques, advancing multimodal VP segmentation for comprehensive analysis in\nclinical and research settings.

                "summary": "E-commerce platforms usually present an ordered list, mixed with several\norganic items and an advertisement, in response to each user's page view\nrequest. This list, the outcome of ad auction and allocation processes,\ndirectly impacts the platform's ad revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV).\nSpecifically, the ad auction determines which ad is displayed and the\ncorresponding payment, while the ad allocation decides the display positions of\nthe advertisement and organic items. The prevalent methods of segregating the\nad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad\nauction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual\ndisplay position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad\nallocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad's payment to determine the\ndisplay position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC)\nfor the advertisement. For instance, in the auction stage employing the\ntraditional Generalized Second Price (GSP) , even if the winning ad increases\nits bid, its payment remains unchanged. This implies that the advertisement\ncannot secure a better position and thus loses the opportunity to achieve\nhigher utility in the subsequent ad allocation stage. Previous research often\nfocused on one of the two stages, neglecting the two-stage problem, which may\nresult in suboptimal outcomes...",

                "summary": "The back-end module of Distributed Collaborative Simultaneous Localization\nand Mapping (DCSLAM) requires solving a nonlinear Pose Graph Optimization (PGO)\nunder a distributed setting, also known as SE(d)-synchronization. Most existing\ndistributed graph optimization algorithms employ a simple sequential\npartitioning scheme, which may result in unbalanced subgraph dimensions due to\nthe different geographic locations of each robot, and hence imposes extra\ncommunication load. Moreover, the performance of current Riemannian\noptimization algorithms can be further accelerated. In this letter, we propose\na novel distributed pose graph optimization algorithm combining multi-level\npartitioning with an accelerated Riemannian optimization method. Firstly, we\nemploy the multi-level graph partitioning algorithm to preprocess the naive\npose graph to formulate a balanced optimization problem. In addition, inspired\nby the accelerated coordinate descent method, we devise an Improved Riemannian\nBlock Coordinate Descent (IRBCD) algorithm and the critical point obtained is\nglobally optimal. Finally, we evaluate the effects of four common graph\npartitioning approaches on the correlation of the inter-subgraphs, and discover\nthat the Highest scheme has the best partitioning performance. Also, we\nimplement simulations to quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm\noutperforms the state-of-the-art distributed pose graph optimization protocols.",

After\nlaying down our theoretical approach in particular discussing how to compute\ncharge and spin bond currents, DFT+NEGF calculations are carried out for ideal\nclean systems. In these the transport is ballistic and the linear response\nlimit is met. The SHE emerges in a central region attached to two leads when we\napply a bias voltage so that electrons are accelerated by a uniform electric\nfield. As a result, we obtain a finite spin-Hall current and, by performing a\nscaling analysis with respect to the system size, we estimate the ballistic\nspin Hall conductivity (SHC). We consider 5d metals with fcc and bcc crystal\nstructures, finding that the SHC exhibits a rough qualitative dependence on the\nd-band filling, and comment on these results in relation to existing\nliterature. Finally, within the same DFT+NEGF approach, we also predict the\nappearance of a current-induced spin dipole moment inside the materials' unit\ncell and estimate its magnitude.",

                "summary": "Controlling the morphology of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) plays a key role in their applications. Although\nchemical vapor deposition can achieve wafer-scale growth of 2D TMDs, a\ncomprehensive theoretical framework for effective growth optimization is\nlacking. Atomistic modeling methods offer a promising approach to delve into\nthe intricate dynamics underlying the growth. In this study, we employ kinetic\nMonte Carlo (kMC) simulations to identify crucial parameters that govern the\nmorphology of MoS2 flakes grown on diverse substrates. Our simulations reveal\nthat large adsorption rates significantly enhance growth speed, which however\nnecessitates rapid edge migration to achieve compact triangles. Substrate\netching can tune the adsorption-desorption process of adatoms and enable\npreferential growth within a specific substrate region, controlling the flake\nmorphology. This study unravels the complex dynamics governing 2D TMD\nmorphology, offering a theoretical framework for decision-making in the design\nand optimization of TMD synthesis processes.",

In this article a method\nwhich enables the identification of statistically significant groups for the\ngrouping step in SSA is presented. The proposed procedure provides a more\nobjective and reliable approach for separating noise from the main signal in\nSSA. We utilize the w- correlation and test if it close or equal to zero. A\nwild bootstrap approach is used to determine the distribution of the\nw-correlation. To identify an ideal number of groupings which leads to almost\nperfect separation of the noise and signal, a given number of groups are\ntested, necessitating accounting for multiplicity. The effectiveness of our\nmethod in identifying the best group is demonstrated through a simulation\nstudy, furthermore, we have applied the approach to real world data in the\ncontext of neuroimaging. This research provides a valuable contribution to the\nfield of SSA and offers important insights into the statistical properties of\nthe w-correlation distribution. The results obtained from the simulation\nstudies and analysis of real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach in identifying the best groupings for SSA.",

                "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers various services to users\nthrough content creation, which is believed to be one of the most important\ncomponents in future networks. However, training and deploying big artificial\nintelligence models (BAIMs) introduces substantial computational and\ncommunication overhead.This poses a critical challenge to centralized\napproaches, due to the need of high-performance computing infrastructure and\nthe reliability, secrecy and timeliness issues in long-distance access of cloud\nservices. Therefore, there is an urging need to decentralize the services,\npartly moving them from the cloud to the edge and establishing native GenAI\nservices to enable private, timely, and personalized experiences. In this\npaper, we propose a brand-new bottom-up BAIM architecture with synergetic big\ncloud model and small edge models, and design a distributed training framework\nand a task-oriented deployment scheme for efficient provision of native GenAI\nservices. The proposed framework can facilitate collaborative intelligence,\nenhance adaptability, gather edge knowledge and alleviate edge-cloud burden.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through an image\ngeneration use case. Finally, we outline fundamental research directions to\nfully exploit the collaborative potential of edge and cloud for native GenAI\nand BAIM applications.",

Motivated by recent efforts that\nprove Multilayer-Perceptrons (MLPs) modules achieving robust structural capture\ncapabilities, even outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this paper aims\nto quantify whether simple MLPs can further enhance the already potent ability\nof PLMs to capture linguistic information. Specifically, we design a simple yet\neffective probing framework containing MLPs components based on BERT structure\nand conduct extensive experiments encompassing 10 probing tasks spanning three\ndistinct linguistic levels. The experimental results demonstrate that MLPs can\nindeed enhance the comprehension of linguistic structure by PLMs. Our research\nprovides interpretable and valuable insights into crafting variations of PLMs\nutilizing MLPs for tasks that emphasize diverse linguistic structures.",

CIL models,\nwhich formalize a realm of interweavings of senses, are not based on possible\nworld semantics or set-theoretic function spaces. Truth-values and references\nof senses are extensions determined by states-of-affairs, an idea that goes\nback to the Stoics.\n  CIL was initially inspired by Bealer's project in Quality and Concept (1983).\nIt was subsequently found that CIL is a good tool to address the shortcomings\nand gaps present in Bealer's approach, in particular with regards to the\nsoundness proofs and the problem of unifying intensional and modal logic.\n  In this paper we focus exclusively on the formal and mathematical foundations\nof CIL including a sketch of the main soundness result.

We reinvestigate the representative but debated chiral CDW of\nTiSe$_{2}$ using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations. Our STM data reveal unambiguously the chiral\ndistortion of the topmost Se layer in domains of opposite chirality, which are\ninterfaced with a novel domain wall. DFT calculations find the atomic structure\nof the chiral CDW, which has a $C2$ symmetry with the inversion and reflection\nsymmetry broken. The chirality is determined by the helicity of Se-Ti bond\ndistortions and their translation between neighboring layers. The present\nstructure reproduces well the STM images with lower energy than the prevailing\nnon-chiral $P\\bar{3}c1$ structure model. Our result provides the atomistic\nunderstanding of the CDW chirality in TiSe$_{2}$, which can be referred to in a\nwide class of monolayer and layered materials with CDW.",

However, the amplitude from such a source is very weak and current\ngravitational-wave interferometers have yet to witness such a signal. The lack\nof detections has provided upper limits on the size of the involved\ndeformations, which are continually being constrained. With expected\nimprovements in detector sensitivities and analysis techniques, there is good\nreason to anticipate an observation in the future. This review concerns the\ncurrent state of the theory of neutron-star mountains. These exotic objects\nhost the extreme regimes of modern physics, which are related to how they\nsustain mountains. We summarise various mechanisms that may give rise to\nasymmetries, including crustal strains built up during the evolutionary history\nof the neutron star, the magnetic field distorting the star's shape and\naccretion episodes gradually constructing a mountain. Moving beyond the simple\nrotating model, we also discuss how precession affects the dynamics and\nmodifies the gravitational-wave signal. We describe the prospects for detection\nand the challenges moving forward.",

                "summary": "This work deals with numerical simulation of water freezing and thawing in a\ncomplex three-dimensional geometry of a porous medium. The porous structure is\nrepresented by a virtual container filled with glass beads. Phase transition\nmodeling is approached at both macro-scale and micro-scale, combining heat\ntransfer in a heterogeneous medium and a phase-field approximation of the\nGibbs-Thomson relation by means of the Allen-Cahn equation. The formulation of\nthe model contains novel components tailored for the given purpose. At the\nmacro-scale, surface tension effects are negligible and phase transition\nfocusing based on temperature can replace the Allen-Cahn equation. In contrast\nto that, simulations of equilibrium states at the micro-scale allow to\neliminate the heat equation by assuming constant supercooling. For numerical\nsolution, an efficient hybrid parallel algorithm based on the finite volume\nmethod and the Runge-Kutta-Merson solver with adaptive time stepping are\nemployed. The results of different model variants at different scales are\ndiscussed. In a parametric study, the full phase-field model is demonstrated to\ndeliver consistent results across a wide range of surface tension values,\nexhibiting curvature-induced premelting if surface tension is artificially\nexaggerated. As surface tension tends to the realistic values, the results of\nthe phase-field approach those of the simplifed temperature-driven phase\ntransition model. In addition, micro-scale simulations of water freezing at\ndifferent supercooling values aim to predict the unfrozen water content and\ncompare the results with data from literature. Numerical stability, accuracy,\nand computational costs are also discussed.",

                "summary": "Many RGBT tracking researches primarily focus on modal fusion design, while\noverlooking the effective handling of target appearance changes. While some\napproaches have introduced historical frames or fuse and replace initial\ntemplates to incorporate temporal information, they have the risk of disrupting\nthe original target appearance and accumulating errors over time. To alleviate\nthese limitations, we propose a novel Transformer RGBT tracking approach, which\nmixes spatio-temporal multimodal tokens from the static multimodal templates\nand multimodal search regions in Transformer to handle target appearance\nchanges, for robust RGBT tracking. We introduce independent dynamic template\ntokens to interact with the search region, embedding temporal information to\naddress appearance changes, while also retaining the involvement of the initial\nstatic template tokens in the joint feature extraction process to ensure the\npreservation of the original reliable target appearance information that\nprevent deviations from the target appearance caused by traditional temporal\nupdates. We also use attention mechanisms to enhance the target features of\nmultimodal template tokens by incorporating supplementary modal cues, and make\nthe multimodal search region tokens interact with multimodal dynamic template\ntokens via attention mechanisms, which facilitates the conveyance of\nmultimodal-enhanced target change information. Our module is inserted into the\ntransformer backbone network and inherits joint feature extraction,\nsearch-template matching, and cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on\nthree RGBT benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach maintains\ncompetitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms\nwhile running at 39.1 FPS.",

                "summary": "The pure CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite is an archetypal example of a strongly\nanharmonic crystal that poses a major challenge for computational methods to\ndescribe its thermodynamic properties. Its lattice dynamics exhibits\ncharacteristics of a phonon liquid: mode coupling, low lifetimes and\n`rattlers'. To study the thermal conduction in this crystal, including the\neffect of dynamic disorder introduced by the Cs rattlers, we apply large-scale\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with machine-learning interatomic\npotentials. We simulate its ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity in the cubic\nphase and obtain phonon spectra by measuring velocity autocorrelation\nfunctions. The thermal conductivity at 500 K is computed to be\n$0.53\\pm0.04\\frac{\\rm W}{\\rm m K}$, which is similar to that of demineralized\nwater under normal indoor conditions. MD based insight into the heat transport\nmechanism of halide perovskites is presented. In the analysis the Cs cations\nare interpreted as damped Einstein oscillators. The phonon bandstructure of a\nsystem with artificially raised Cs masses demonstrates an increased\ninterference of the Cs rattling with the acoustic phonon modes. We show that\nthe thermal conductivity of the CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite can still be slightly\ndecreased by tuning the cation rattling frequency into the range of the low\nlying acoustic mode",

                "summary": "The availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data is\nincreasing along with the availability of different GPS receivers and with the\nincreasing use of various mobility services. GPS trajectory is an important\ndata source which is used in traffic density detection, transport mode\ndetection, mapping data inferences with the use of different methods such as\nimage processing and machine learning methods. While the data size increases,\nefficient representation of this type of data is becoming difficult to be used\nin these methods. A common approach is the representation of GPS trajectory\ninformation such as average speed, bearing, etc. in raster image form and\napplying analysis methods. In this study, we evaluate GPS trajectory data\nrasterization using the spatial join functions of QGIS, PostGIS+QGIS, and our\niterative spatial structured grid aggregation implementation coded in the\nPython programming language. Our implementation is also parallelizable, and\nthis parallelization is also included as the fourth method. According to the\nresults of experiment carried out with an example GPS trajectory dataset, QGIS\nmethod and PostGIS+QGIS method showed relatively low performance with respect\nto our method using the metric of total processing time. PostGIS+QGIS method\nachieved the best results for spatial join though its total performance\ndecreased quickly while test area size increases. On the other hand, both of\nour methods' performances decrease directly proportional to GPS point. And our\nmethods' performance can be increased proportional to the increase with the\nnumber of processor cores and/or with multiple computing clusters.",

When a magnetic\nfield $H$ is switched on, a rich variety of different phases develops from the\ncuboctahedral ground state, which are studied in their dependence on $H$ and a\ncross-plaquette coupling constant $J_3>0$. For the AF square-kagom\\'{e} spin\nlattice, we carefully identify and describe seven phases that appear in a phase\ndiagram with five triple points. The transitions between these phases are\npredominantly discontinuous, although two cases exhibit continuous transitions.\nIn contrast, the phase diagram of the AF/FM square-kagom\\'{e} model shows only\nfour phases with a single triple point, but these also lead to exotic\nmagnetization curves.

Parquet theory\ncomputes the two-body scattering amplitude, respecting its crossing symmetry.\nPhi derivability computes the nonequilibrium one-body dynamics, respecting\nconservation in the two-body response. Parquet cannot safeguard conservation\nand Phi derivability cannot guarantee crossing symmetry, yet both are physical\nrequirements.

                "summary": "Since the successful synthesis of the MoSSe monolayer, which violated the\nout-of-plane mirror symmetry of TMDs monolayers, considerable and systematic\nresearch has been conducted on Janus monolayer materials. By systematically\nanalyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus\nmaterial by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The\nstructural optimizations have been carried out using the FP-LAPW (Full\nPotential Linear Augmented Plane Wave) basis, as implemented in the ELK using\ntb-mBJ exchange correlation potential. Computed structural parameters are in\ngood comparison with literature reports. Further, optimized crystal structures\nwere used for computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric\nproperties using pseudo potential based Quantum espresso code. Dynamical\nstability predicts material can withstand strain upto 10% strain. Computed\nelectronic structure reveals material to be indirect wide bandgap ferromagnetic\nmaterial with magnetic moment 1{\\mu}B. With increase in the biaxial tensile\nstrain the band gap increases. Furthermore, the computed magneto-thermoelectric\nproperties predicts high Seebeck coefficient of ~ 400 {\\mu}V/K and low thermal\nconductivity of ~ 1.13 X 1014 W/msK in LaBrI which results high ZT of ~ 1.92\nwith 8% strain at 800 K with p-type doping. Thus, present study supports the\nfact that tensile strain on ferromagnetic LaBrI material can further enhance TE\nproperties and making it to be a promising material for TE applications at\nhigher temperature.",

However, Coordinated Inhautentic Behaviour (CIB),\ndefined as orchestrated efforts by entities to deceive or mislead users about\ntheir identity and intentions, has emerged as a tactic to exploit the online\ndiscourse. In this study, we quantify the efficacy of CIB tactics by defining a\ngeneral framework for evaluating the influence of a subset of nodes in a\ndirected tree. We design two algorithms that provide optimal and greedy\npost-hoc placement strategies that lead to maximising the configuration\ninfluence. We then consider cascades from information spreading on Twitter to\ncompare the observed behaviour with our algorithms. The results show that,\naccording to our model, coordinated accounts are quite inefficient in terms of\ntheir network influence, thus suggesting that they may play a less pivotal role\nthan expected. Moreover, the causes of these poor results may be found in two\nseparate aspects: a bad placement strategy and a scarcity of resources.",

However, the complex anatomical structure and\nconnectivity of RGVP make it challenging to achieve accurate segmentation. In\nthis study, we propose a novel Modality Exchange Network (ME-Net) that\neffectively utilizes multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging information to\nenhance RGVP segmentation. Our ME-Net has two main contributions. Firstly, we\nintroduce an effective multi-modal soft-exchange technique. Specifically, we\ndesign a channel and spatially mixed attention module to exchange modality\ninformation between T1-weighted and fractional anisotropy MR images. Secondly,\nwe propose a cross-fusion module that further enhances the fusion of\ninformation between the two modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of RGVP\nsegmentation performance.",

                "summary": "Online contextual reasoning and association across consecutive video frames\nare critical to perceive instances in visual tracking. However, most current\ntop-performing trackers persistently lean on sparse temporal relationships\nbetween reference and search frames via an offline mode. Consequently, they can\nonly interact independently within each image-pair and establish limited\ntemporal correlations. To alleviate the above problem, we propose a simple,\nflexible and effective video-level tracking pipeline, named \\textbf{ODTrack},\nwhich densely associates the contextual relationships of video frames in an\nonline token propagation manner. ODTrack receives video frames of arbitrary\nlength to capture the spatio-temporal trajectory relationships of an instance,\nand compresses the discrimination features (localization information) of a\ntarget into a token sequence to achieve frame-to-frame association. This new\nsolution brings the following benefits: 1) the purified token sequences can\nserve as prompts for the inference in the next video frame, whereby past\ninformation is leveraged to guide future inference; 2) the complex online\nupdate strategies are effectively avoided by the iterative propagation of token\nsequences, and thus we can achieve more efficient model representation and\ncomputation. ODTrack achieves a new \\textit{SOTA} performance on seven\nbenchmarks, while running at real-time speed. Code and models are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack}.",

The\nmethod arises from a regularisation of the variational formulation of the\nLandau equation, leading to a discretisation of the collision operator that\nconserves mass, charge, momentum, and energy, while increasing the\n(regularised) entropy. The collisional effects appear as a fully deterministic\neffective force, thus the method does not require any transport-collision\nsplitting. The scheme can be used in arbitrary dimension, and for a general\ninteraction, including the Coulomb case. We validate the scheme on scenarios\nsuch as the Landau damping, the two-stream instability, and the Weibel\ninstability, demonstrating its effectiveness in the numerical simulation of\nplasma.",

Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due\nto differences in members' perceptions of challenges which may benefit from\nexternal support. In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging\nthree distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge\nrule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language\nmodel (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification\n(cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from\nstudent discourse, was investigated. The results show that the supervised ML\nand the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast\nto the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered\nfeatures by experts. The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three\napproaches' performance for automated detection and support of students'\nchallenge moments in collaborative learning activities. It argues that,\nalthough LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to\nissues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of\nlearning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity\nevaluation, privacy and confabulation. We conclude the paper with a discussion\non additional considerations, including model transparency to explore feasible\nand meaningful analytical feedback for students and educators using LLMs.",

                "summary": "Femtosecond optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) are widely used in\nultrafast nonlinear frequency conversion and quantum information. However,\nconventional OPOs based on quasi-phase-matching (QPM) crystals have many\nparasitic non-phase-matched processes which decreases the conversion\nefficiency. Here, we propose nine-wave coupled equations (NWCEs) to simulate\nall phase-matched and non-phase-matched interactions in QPM crystals to improve\nconventional three-wave coupled equations (TWCEs), especially for the situation\nof high intensity ultrashort pulses and complexly structured crystals. We\ndiscuss how to design the poling period of QPM crystal to maximize the\nconversion efficiency of signal light for a given OPO system. The simulation\nreveals that the OPO based on chirped periodically poled lithium niobate\n(CPPLN) with certain chirp rate has higher signal wave conversion efficiency\nthan that of a PPLN, and demonstrates that NWCEs illustrates more details of\nthe pulse evolution in the OPO cavity. Starting from a CPPLN, an aperiodically\npoled lithium niobate (APPLN) design is available by modifying the domain\nlengths of the crystal and optimizing the OPO output power via dynamical\noptimization algorithm. The results show that by using a properly designed\nAPPLN crystal, a 1600nm OPO, when pumped by a femtosecond laser with 1030nm\ncentral wavelength, 150 femtosecond pulse duration and 5 GW/cm2 power intensity\nat the focus, can achieve very efficient output with a signal light conversion\nefficiency of 50.6%, which is higher than that of PPLN (25.2%) and CPPLN\n(40.2%). The scheme in this paper will provide a reference for the design of\nnonlinear QPM crystals of OPOs and will help to understand the complex\nnonlinear dynamical behavior in OPO cavities.",

We address the challenge of simplifying artistic\ntypography for non-professionals by offering a dynamic, adaptive, and\ncomputationally efficient alternative to traditional rigid templates. Our\napproach leverages the power of LLMs to understand and interpret user input,\nfacilitating a more intuitive design process. We demonstrate through various\ncase studies how users can articulate their aesthetic preferences and\nfunctional requirements, which the system then translates into unique and\ncreative typographic designs. Our evaluations indicate significant improvements\nin user satisfaction, design flexibility, and creative expression over existing\nsystems. The WordArt Designer API not only democratizes the art of typography\nbut also opens up new possibilities for personalized digital communication and\ndesign.",

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available source\ncode have established a new state of the art in code generation tasks. However,\nthese models are mostly unaware of the code that exists within a specific\nproject, preventing the models from making good use of existing APIs. Instead,\nLLMs often invent, or \"hallucinate\", non-existent APIs or produce variants of\nalready existing code. This paper presents De-Hallucinator, a technique that\ngrounds the predictions of an LLM through a novel combination of retrieving\nsuitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly\nsuitable context information in the prompt. The approach exploits the\nobservation that predictions by LLMs often resemble the desired code, but they\nfail to correctly refer to already existing APIs. De-Hallucinator automatically\nidentifies project-specific API references related to the model's initial\npredictions and adds these references into the prompt. Unlike\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), our approach uses the initial\nprediction(s) by the model to iteratively retrieve increasingly suitable API\nreferences. Our evaluation applies the approach to two tasks: predicting API\nusages in Python and generating tests in JavaScript. We show that\nDe-Hallucinator consistently improves the generated code across five LLMs. In\nparticular, the approach improves the edit distance by 23.3-50.6% and the\nrecall of correctly predicted API usages by 23.9-61.0% for code completion, and\nimproves the number of fixed tests that initially failed because of\nhallucinations by 63.2%, resulting in a 15.5% increase in statement coverage\nfor test generation.",

This approach differs\nmarkedly from existing methods, which are confined to 2D spaces and typically\nrely on textual instructions, leading to ambiguity and limited control. Image\nSculpting converts 2D objects into 3D, enabling direct interaction with their\n3D geometry. Post-editing, these objects are re-rendered into 2D, merging into\nthe original image to produce high-fidelity results through a coarse-to-fine\nenhancement process. The framework supports precise, quantifiable, and\nphysically-plausible editing options such as pose editing, rotation,\ntranslation, 3D composition, carving, and serial addition. It marks an initial\nstep towards combining the creative freedom of generative models with the\nprecision of graphics pipelines.",

                "summary": "The braiding operations of quantum states have attracted substantial\nattention due to their great potential for realizing topological quantum\ncomputations. In this paper, we show that a three-fold degenerate eigen\nsubspace can be obtained in a four-level Hamiltonian which is the minimal\nphysical system. Braiding operations are proposed to apply to dressed states in\nthe subspace. The topology of the braiding diagram can be characterized through\nphysical methods once that the sequential braiding pulses are adopted. We\nestablish an equivalent relationship function between the permutation group and\nthe output states where different output states correspond to different values\nof the function. The topological transition of the braiding happens when two\noperations overlap, which is detectable through the measurement of the\nfunction. Combined with the phase variation method, we can analyze the wringing\npattern of the braiding. Therefore, the experimentally-feasible system provides\na platform to investigate braiding dynamics, the SU(3) physics and the qutrit\ngates.",

                "summary": "We present a theoretical study of the medium modifications of the $p_T$\nbalance ($x_J$) of dijets in Xe+Xe collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.44$ TeV. The\ninitial production of dijets was carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8\nprescription, which matches the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD matrix elements\nwith the parton shower (PS) effect. The SHELL model described the in-medium\nevolution of nucleus-nucleus collisions using a transport approach. The\ntheoretical results of the dijet $x_J$ in the Xe+Xe collisions exhibit more\nimbalanced distributions than those in the p+p collisions, consistent with\nrecently reported ATLAS data. By utilizing the Interleaved Flavor\nNeutralisation, an infrared-and-collinear-safe jet flavor algorithm, to\nidentify the flavor of the reconstructed jets, we classify dijets processes\ninto three categories: gluon-gluon ($gg$), quark-gluon ($qg$), and quark-quark\n($qq$), and investigated the respective medium modification patterns and\nfraction changes of the $gg$, $qg$, and $qq$ components of the dijet sample in\nXe+Xe collisions. It is shown that the increased fraction of $qg$ component at\na small $x_J$ contributes to the imbalance of the dijet; in particular, the\n$q_1g_2$ (quark-jet-leading) dijets experience more significant asymmetric\nenergy loss than the $g_1q_2$ (gluon-jet-leading) dijets traversing the QGP. By\ncomparing the $\\Delta \\langle x_J\\rangle = \\langle x_J \\rangle_{pp} - \\langle\nx_J \\rangle_{AA}$ of inclusive, $c\\bar{c}$ and $b\\bar{b}$ dijets in Xe+Xe\ncollisions, we observe $\\Delta\\langle x_J \\rangle_{incl.}>\\Delta \\langle x_J\n\\rangle_{c\\bar{c}}>\\Delta \\langle x_J \\rangle_{b\\bar{b}}$. Moreover, $\\rho_{Xe,\nPb}$, the ratios of the nuclear modification factors of dijets in Xe+Xe to\nthose in Pb+Pb, were calculated, which indicates that the yield suppression of\ndijets in Pb+Pb is more pronounced than that in Xe+Xe owing to the larger\nradius of the lead nucleus.",

The main radio structure of SNR G352.7-0.1 forms an outer (large)\nellipse. The bright X-ray emitting gas forms a smaller ellipse with a symmetry\naxis inclined to the symmetry axis of the large radio ellipse. The high\nabundance of iron and the energy of its X-ray lines suggest a type Ia supernova\n(SN Ia). The massive swept-up gas suggests a relatively massive progenitor\nsystem. I propose a scenario with progenitors of initial masses of M1=5-7Mo and\nM2=4-5 Mo. At a later phase, the WD remnant of the primary star and the AGB\nsecondary star experience a CEE that ejects the circumstellar material that\nswept up more ISM to form the large elliptical radio structure. An explosion\nduring the merger of the WD with the core of the AGB star triggered a\nsuper-Chandrasekhar thermonuclear explosion that formed the inner structure\nthat is bright in X-ray. A tertiary star in the system caused the misalignment\nof the two symmetry axes. This study adds to the wide variety of evolutionary\nroutes within the scenarios of normal and peculiar SNe Ia.",

                "summary": "We report on a search for a new $Z'$ ($L_\\mu-L_\\tau$) vector boson performed\nat the NA64 experiment employing a high energy muon beam and a missing\nenergy-momentum technique. Muons from the M2 beamline at the CERN Super Proton\nSynchrotron with a momentum of 160 GeV/c are directed to an active target. A\nsignal event is a single scattered muon with momentum $<$ 80 GeV/c in the final\nstate, accompanied by missing energy, i.e. no detectable activity in the\ndownstream calorimeters. For a total statistic of $(1.98\\pm0.02)\\times10^{10}$\nmuons on target, no event is observed in the expected signal region. This\nallows us to set new limits on part of the remaining $(m_{Z'},\\ g_{Z'})$\nparameter space which could provide an explanation for the muon $(g-2)_\\mu$\nanomaly. Additionally, our study excludes part of the parameter space suggested\nby the thermal Dark Matter relic abundance. Our results pave the way to explore\nDark Sectors and light Dark Matter with muon beams in a unique and\ncomplementary way to other experiments.",

The equations are coupled via the\ntemperature in the coefficients of the JMGT equation and via a nonlinear source\nterm within the Pennes equation, which models the absorption of acoustic energy\nby the surrounding tissue. Using the energy method together with a fixed point\nargument, we prove that our model is locally well-posed, provided that the\ninitial data are regular, small in a lower topology and the final time is short\nenough.",

                "summary": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the\nsecurity of neural networks. Existing works have leveraged the fact that\nIn-distribution (ID) samples form a subspace in the feature space, achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, the comprehensive characteristics\nof the ID subspace still leave under-explored. Recently, the discovery of\nNeural Collapse ($\\mathcal{NC}$) sheds light on novel properties of the ID\nsubspace. Leveraging insight from $\\mathcal{NC}$, we observe that the Principal\nAngle between the features and the ID feature subspace forms a superior\nrepresentation for measuring the likelihood of OOD. Building upon this\nobservation, we propose a novel $\\mathcal{NC}$-inspired OOD scoring function,\nnamed Entropy-enhanced Principal Angle (EPA), which integrates both the global\ncharacteristic of the ID subspace and its inner property. We experimentally\ncompare EPA with various SOTA approaches, validating its superior performance\nand robustness across different network architectures and OOD datasets.",

We also introduce\nnew schemes for ordinary massive and massless particles based on states with\nfixed total momentum, in contrast to all protocols already proposed, which\nassumed equal momenta of all the particles involved in the encoding scheme.\nMoreover, we provide a systematic discussion of already existing protocols and\nshow directly that they are invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations\ndrawn according to any distribution, a fact which was not manifestly shown in\nprevious works.",

                "summary": "Many-body open quantum systems (OQS) have a profound impact on various\nsubdisciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. Thus, the development of a\ncomputer program capable of accurately, efficiently, and versatilely simulating\nmany-body OQS is highly desirable. In recent years, we have focused on the\nadvancement of numerical algorithms based on the fermionic hierarchical\nequations of motion (HEOM) theory. Being in-principle exact, this approach\nallows for the precise characterization of many-body correlations,\nnon-Markovian memory, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. These\nefforts now lead to the establishment of a new computer program, HEOM for\nQUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel, version 2 (HEOM-QUICK2), which, to\nthe best of our knowledge, is currently the only general-purpose simulator for\nfermionic many-body OQS. Compared with version 1, the HEOM-QUICK2 program\nfeatures more efficient solvers for stationary states, more accurate treatment\nof non-Markovian memory, and improved numerical stability for long-time\ndissipative dynamics. Integrated with quantum chemistry software, HEOM-QUICK2\nhas become a valuable theoretical tool for the precise simulation of realistic\nmany-body OQS, particularly the single atomic or molecular junctions.\nFurthermore, the unprecedented precision achieved by HEOM-QUICK2 enables\naccurate simulation of low-energy spin excitations and coherent spin\nrelaxation. The unique usefulness of HEOM-QUICK2 is demonstrated through\nseveral examples of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems under\nnon-equilibrium conditions. Thus, the new HEOM-QUICK2 program offers a powerful\nand comprehensive tool for studying many-body OQS with exotic quantum phenomena\nand exploring applications in various disciplines.",

A\nconnected $k$-subpartition of $G$ is a collection of $k$ pairwise disjoint sets\n(a.k.a. classes) of vertices in $G$ such that each set induces a connected\nsubgraph. The connected $k$-partition polytope of $G$, denoted by $P(G,k)$, is\ndefined as the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all connected\n$k$-subpartitions of $G$. Many applications arising in off-shore oil-drilling,\nforest planning, image processing, cluster analysis, political districting,\npolice patrolling, and biology are modeled in terms of finding connected\n(sub)partitions of a graph. This study focus on the facial structure of\n$P(G,k)$ and the computational complexity of the corresponding separation\nproblems. We first propose a set of valid inequalities having non-null\ncoefficients associated with a single class that extends and generalizes the\nones in the literature of related problems, show sufficient conditions for\nthese inequalities to be facet-defining, and design a polynomial-time\nseparation algorithm for them. We also devise two sets of inequalities that\nconsider multiple classes, prove when they define facets, and study the\ncomputational complexity of associated separation problems.",

                "summary": "We introduce the RHDLPP, a flux-limited multigroup radiation hydrodynamics\nnumerical code designed for simulating laser-produced plasmas in diverse\nenvironments. The code bifurcates into two packages: RHDLPP-LTP for\nlow-temperature plasmas generated by moderate-intensity nanosecond lasers, and\nRHDLPP-HTP for high-temperature, high-density plasmas formed by high-intensity\nlaser pulses. The core radiation hydrodynamic equations are resolved in the\nEulerian frame, employing an operator-split method. This method decomposes the\nsolution into two substeps: first, the explicit resolution of the hyperbolic\nsubsystems integrating radiation and fluid dynamics, and second, the implicit\ntreatment of the parabolic part comprising stiff radiation diffusion, heat\nconduction, and energy exchange. Laser propagation and energy deposition are\nmodeled through a hybrid approach, combining geometrical optics ray-tracing in\nsub-critical plasma regions with a one-dimensional solution of the Helmholtz\nwave equation in super-critical areas. The thermodynamic states are ascertained\nusing an equation of state, based on either the real gas approximation or the\nquotidian equation of state (QEOS). Additionally, RHDLPP includes\nRHDLPP-SpeIma3D, a three-dimensional spectral simulation post-processing\nmodule, for generating both temporally-spatially resolved and time-integrated\nspectra and imaging, facilitating direct comparisons with experimental data.\nThe paper showcases a series of verification tests to establish the code's\naccuracy and efficiency, followed by application cases, including simulations\nof laser-produced aluminum (Al) plasmas, pre-pulse-induced target deformation\nof tin (Sn) microdroplets relevant to extreme ultraviolet lithography light\nsources, and varied imaging and spectroscopic simulations.",

The system\ndeploys the ORB algorithm to extract image features and the GMS algorithm to\nremove incorrect matching points. According to the principles of clustering and\ntemplate locality, a method known as Local Adaptive Clustering (LAC) has been\nestablished to enhance label positioning.

                "summary": "Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based solutions are\nwell-established for limited feedback schemes in frequency division duplex\n(FDD) systems. In recent years, data-aided solutions have been shown to achieve\nhigher performance, enabled by the adaptivity of the feedback scheme to the\npropagation environment of the base station (BS) cell. In particular, a\nversatile limited feedback scheme utilizing Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) was\nrecently introduced. The scheme supports multi-user communications, exhibits\nlow complexity, supports parallelization, and offers significant flexibility\nconcerning various system parameters. Conceptually, a GMM captures environment\nknowledge and is subsequently transferred to the mobile terminals (MTs) for\nonline inference of feedback information. Afterward, the BS designs precoders\nusing either directional information or a generative modeling-based approach. A\nmajor shortcoming of recent works is that the assessed system performance is\nonly evaluated through synthetic simulation data that is generally unable to\nfully characterize the features of real-world environments. It raises the\nquestion of how the GMM-based feedback scheme performs on real-world\nmeasurement data, especially compared to the well-established DFT-based\nsolution. Our experiments reveal that the GMM-based feedback scheme\ntremendously improves the system performance measured in terms of sum-rate,\nallowing to deploy systems with fewer pilots or feedback bits.",

We analyze in detail the order conditions\nthat have to be satisfied by these classes of methods to achieve a given order,\nand provide some insight about their qualitative properties in connection with\ngeometric numerical integration and the treatment of highly oscillatory\nproblems. Since splitting methods have received considerable attention in the\nrealm of partial differential equations, we also cover this subject in the\npresent survey, with special attention to parabolic equations and their\nproblems. An exhaustive list of methods of different orders is collected and\ntested on simple examples. Finally, some applications of splitting methods in\ndifferent areas, ranging from celestial mechanics to statistics, are also\nprovided.",

                "summary": "JPEG is a widely used compression scheme to efficiently reduce the volume of\ntransmitted images. The artifacts appear among blocks due to the information\nloss, which not only affects the quality of images but also harms the\nsubsequent high-level tasks in terms of feature drifting. High-level vision\nmodels trained on high-quality images will suffer performance degradation when\ndealing with compressed images, especially on mobile devices. Numerous\nlearning-based JPEG artifact removal methods have been proposed to handle\nvisual artifacts. However, it is not an ideal choice to use these JPEG artifact\nremoval methods as a pre-processing for compressed image classification for the\nfollowing reasons: 1. These methods are designed for human vision rather than\nhigh-level vision models; 2. These methods are not efficient enough to serve as\npre-processing on resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes a novel lightweight AFD module to boost the performance of\npre-trained image classification models when facing compressed images. First, a\nFDE-Net is devised to generate the spatial-wise FDM in the DCT domain. Next,\nthe estimated FDM is transmitted to the FE-Net to generate the mapping\nrelationship between degraded features and corresponding high-quality features.\nA simple but effective RepConv block equipped with structural\nre-parameterization is utilized in FE-Net, which enriches feature\nrepresentation in the training phase while maintaining efficiency in the\ndeployment phase. After training on limited compressed images, the AFD-Module\ncan serve as a \"plug-and-play\" model for pre-trained classification models to\nimprove their performance on compressed images. Experiments demonstrate that\nour proposed AFD module can comprehensively improve the accuracy of the\npre-trained classification models and significantly outperform the existing\nmethods.",

To address this limitation,\nwe extend the original MP-QKD to asymmetric cases. Our decoy-state estimation\nconfirms that asymmetric channel transmittances and asymmetric intensities do\nnot compromise the security of the protocol. We focus on the pulse-intensity\nrelationship, a key factor for optimizing the performance of asymmetric MP-QKD.\nUnlike previous asymmetric protocols, the intensities of different bases in\nasymmetric MP-QKD cannot be decoupled. We introduce an optimal-pulse-intensity\nmethod, adaptable to various scenarios, to enhance key rates by calculating\nideal pulse intensities.

This trend is expected to continue. However, the increasing size of\nthese models poses challenges in training, as traditional centralized methods\nare limited by memory constraints at such scales. This paper proposes an\nasynchronous decentralized training paradigm for large modern deep learning\nmodels that harnesses the compute power of regular heterogeneous PCs with\nlimited resources connected across the internet to achieve favourable\nperformance metrics. Ravnest facilitates decentralized training by efficiently\norganizing compute nodes into clusters with similar data transfer rates and\ncompute capabilities, without necessitating that each node hosts the entire\nmodel. These clusters engage in $\\textit{Zero-Bubble Asynchronous Model\nParallel}$ training, and a $\\textit{Parallel Multi-Ring All-Reduce}$ method is\nemployed to effectively execute global parameter averaging across all clusters.\nWe have framed our asynchronous SGD loss function as a block structured\noptimization problem with delayed updates and derived an optimal convergence\nrate of $O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right)$. We further discuss linear speedup\nwith respect to the number of participating clusters and the bound on the\nstaleness parameter.",

The present research\nwork investigates the implementation of EIS technique supported by several\noptical spectroscopic techniques such as Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) and\nFourier Transform Mid Infrared (FT-MIR) to detect and quantify several toxic\nadulterants in foods and bio-consumables. A comprehensive understanding on the\nbackground theory related to the study has been developed to analyze the\noverall polarization of the system and the effect of frequency on complex\npermittivity of such system have been observed. In the current work, the\ntechnique is applied to adulterated saccharides, honey and turmeric samples\nthrough a prototype sensing device. All the corresponding measurements have\nbeen performed by dipping a custom-made parallel plate conductivity cell with\nunity cell constant inside the solution under test. EIS study exhibited a\nsteady variation of electrical parameters such as impedance, capacitance,\nconductance and current values with increasing adulterant percentage in the\nsolution. Variation in such properties due to adulteration provides a\nsystematic sensor plot through which one can determine their percentage of\nadulteration in unknown adulterated samples. Co-efficient of sensitivity has\nbeen extracted from the EIS data for adulteration study in terms of one of the\nmeasured parameters. The results of UV-Vis and FT-MIR studies have been used\nfor comparative analyses which corroborate with the EIS results, wherever\napplicable.",

                "summary": "The recovery of 3D human mesh from monocular images has significantly been\ndeveloped in recent years. However, existing models usually ignore spatial and\ntemporal information, which might lead to mesh and image misalignment and\ntemporal discontinuity. For this reason, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal\nAlignment Fusion (STAF) model. As a video-based model, it leverages coherence\nclues from human motion by an attention-based Temporal Coherence Fusion Module\n(TCFM). As for spatial mesh-alignment evidence, we extract fine-grained local\ninformation through predicted mesh projection on the feature maps. Based on the\nspatial features, we further introduce a multi-stage adjacent Spatial Alignment\nFusion Module (SAFM) to enhance the feature representation of the target frame.\nIn addition to the above, we propose an Average Pooling Module (APM) to allow\nthe model to focus on the entire input sequence rather than just the target\nframe. This method can remarkably improve the smoothness of recovery results\nfrom video. Extensive experiments on 3DPW, MPII3D, and H36M demonstrate the\nsuperiority of STAF. We achieve a state-of-the-art trade-off between precision\nand smoothness. Our code and more video results are on the project page\nhttps://yw0208.github.io/staf/",

The\npump-probe geometry has its advantage of overlapping only two beams and\nreducing phase cycling steps. However, its applications are typically limited\nto observe the dynamics with single-quantum coherence and population, leaving\nthe challenge to measure the dynamics of the double-quantum (2Q) coherence,\nwhich reflects the many-body interactions. We propose an experimental technique\nin 2DES under pump-probe geometry with a designed pulse sequence and the signal\nprocessing method to extract 2Q coherence. In the designed pulse sequence with\nthe probe pulse arriving earlier than pump pulses, our measured signal includes\nthe 2Q signal as well as the zero-quantum (0Q) signal. With phase cycling and\nthe data processing using causality enforcement, we extract the 2Q signal. The\nproposal is demonstrated with the rubidium atoms. And we observe the collective\nresonances of two-body dipole-dipole interactions of both $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$\nlines.",

                "summary": "Assistive robots should be able to wash, fold or iron clothes. However, due\nto the variety, deformability and self-occlusions of clothes, creating robot\nsystems for cloth manipulation is challenging. Synthetic data is a promising\ndirection to improve generalization, but the sim-to-real gap limits its\neffectiveness. To advance the use of synthetic data for cloth manipulation\ntasks such as robotic folding, we present a synthetic data pipeline to train\nkeypoint detectors for almost-flattened cloth items. To evaluate its\nperformance, we have also collected a real-world dataset. We train detectors\nfor both T-shirts, towels and shorts and obtain an average precision of 64% and\nan average keypoint distance of 18 pixels. Fine-tuning on real-world data\nimproves performance to 74% mAP and an average distance of only 9 pixels.\nFurthermore, we describe failure modes of the keypoint detectors and compare\ndifferent approaches to obtain cloth meshes and materials. We also quantify the\nremaining sim-to-real gap and argue that further improvements to the fidelity\nof cloth assets will be required to further reduce this gap. The code, dataset\nand trained models are available",

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used as the backbones for\ngeneral-purpose agents, and some economics literature suggest that LLMs are\ncapable of playing various types of economics games. Following these works, to\novercome the limitation of evaluating LLMs using static benchmarks, we propose\nto explore competitive games as an evaluation for LLMs to incorporate\nmulti-players and dynamicise the environment. By varying the game history\nrevealed to LLMs-based players, we find that most of LLMs are rational in that\nthey play strategies that can increase their payoffs, but not as rational as\nindicated by Nash Equilibria (NEs). Moreover, when game history are available,\ncertain types of LLMs, such as GPT-4, can converge faster to the NE strategies,\nwhich suggests higher rationality level in comparison to other models. In the\nmeantime, certain types of LLMs can win more often when game history are\navailable, and we argue that the winning rate reflects the reasoning ability\nwith respect to the strategies of other players. Throughout all our\nexperiments, we observe that the ability to strictly follow the game rules\ndescribed by natural languages also vary among the LLMs we tested. In this\nwork, we provide an economics arena for the LLMs research community as a\ndynamic simulation to test the above-mentioned abilities of LLMs, i.e.\nrationality, strategic reasoning ability, and instruction-following capability.",

                "summary": "Multi-modal (vision-language) models, such as CLIP, are replacing traditional\nsupervised pre-training models (e.g., ImageNet-based pre-training) as the new\ngeneration of visual foundation models. These models with robust and aligned\nsemantic representations learned from billions of internet image-text pairs and\ncan be applied to various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, in\nsome fine-grained domains like medical imaging and remote sensing, the\nperformance of multi-modal foundation models often leaves much to be desired.\nConsequently, many researchers have begun to explore few-shot adaptation\nmethods for these models, gradually deriving three main technical approaches:\n1) prompt-based methods, 2) adapter-based methods, and 3) external\nknowledge-based methods. Nevertheless, this rapidly developing field has\nproduced numerous results without a comprehensive survey to systematically\norganize the research progress. Therefore, in this survey, we introduce and\nanalyze the research advancements in few-shot adaptation methods for\nmulti-modal models, summarizing commonly used datasets and experimental setups,\nand comparing the results of different methods. In addition, due to the lack of\nreliable theoretical support for existing methods, we derive the few-shot\nadaptation generalization error bound for multi-modal models. The theorem\nreveals that the generalization error of multi-modal foundation models is\nconstrained by three factors: domain gap, model capacity, and sample size.\nBased on this, we propose three possible solutions from the following aspects:\n1) adaptive domain generalization, 2) adaptive model selection, and 3) adaptive\nknowledge utilization.",

We\naddress the necessary conditions for this diffuse ($n \\approx 30$ cm$^{-3}$),\ncold (T $\\approx$ 60 K), magnetized gas undergoing shock waves and supersonic\nturbulence, to produce filamentary structures capable of fragmenting into\ncluster forming regions. Using RAMSES and a magnetized CNM environment as our\ninitial conditions, we simulate a 0.5 kpc turbulent box to model a uniform gas\nwith magnetic field strength of 7 $\\mu G$, varying the 3D velocity dispersion\nvia decaying turbulence. We use a surface density of $320 M_{\\odot} pc^{-2}$,\nrepresentative of the inner 4.0 kpc CMZ of the Milky Way and typical luminous\ngalaxies. Filamentary molecular clouds are formed dynamically via shocks within\na narrow range of velocity dispersions in the CNM of 5 - 10 km/s with a\npreferred value at 8 km/s. Cluster sink particles appear in filaments which\nexceed their critical line mass, occurring optimally for velocity dispersions\nof 8 km/s. Tracking the evolution of magnetic fields, we find that they lead to\ndouble the dense star forming gas than in purely hydro runs. Perpendicular\norientations between magnetic field and filaments can increase the accretion\nrates onto filaments and hence their line masses. Because magnetic fields help\nsupport gas, MHD runs result in average temperatures an order of magnitude\nhigher than unmagnetized counterparts. Finally, we find magnetic fields delay\nthe onset of cluster formation by $\\propto 0.4$ Myr.",

                "summary": "Benefitting from the vast spatial degrees of freedom, the amalgamation of\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) is expected to simultaneously improve spectral and\nenergy efficiencies as well as the sensing capability. However, a large number\nof antennas deployed in massive MIMO-ISAC raises critical challenges in\nacquiring both accurate channel state information and target parameter\ninformation. To overcome these two challenges with a unified framework, we\nfirst analyze their underlying system models and then propose a novel\ntensor-based approach that addresses both the channel estimation and target\nsensing problems. Specifically, by parameterizing the high-dimensional\ncommunication channel exploiting a small number of physical parameters, we\nassociate the channel state information with the sensing parameters of targets\nin terms of angular, delay, and Doppler dimensions. Then, we propose a shared\ntraining pattern adopting the same time-frequency resources such that both the\nchannel estimation and target parameter estimation can be formulated as a\ncanonical polyadic decomposition problem with a similar mathematical\nexpression. On this basis, we first investigate the uniqueness condition of the\ntensor factorization and the maximum number of resolvable targets by utilizing\nthe specific Vandermonde",

                "summary": "This paper introduces a new type of soft continuum robot, called SCoReS,\nwhich is capable of self-controlling continuously its curvature at the segment\nlevel; in contrast to previous designs which either require external forces or\nmachine elements, or whose variable curvature capabilities are discrete --\ndepending on the number of locking mechanisms and segments. The ability to have\na variable curvature, whose control is continuous and independent from external\nfactors, makes a soft continuum robot more adaptive in constrained\nenvironments, similar to what is observed in nature in the elephant's trunk or\nostrich's neck for instance which exhibit multiple curvatures. To this end, our\nsoft continuum robot enables reconfigurable variable curvatures utilizing a\nvariable stiffness growing spine based on micro-particle granular jamming for\nthe first time. We detail the design of the proposed robot, presenting its\nmodeling through beam theory and FEA simulation -- which is validated through\nexperiments. The robot's versatile bending profiles are then explored in\nexperiments and an application to grasp fruits at different configurations is\ndemonstrated.",
